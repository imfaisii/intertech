Or do you want to make music but aren't sure where to begin? As an artist or songwriter, composing a great song that will get your message across and grab your listeners' attention requires a distinct understanding of music theory. This course will explore the music theory you need to know to start writing songs and music. You won't get bogged down trying to learn unnecessary things to write pop, rock, folk, country, EDM or other musical genres. Instead, Michael Emenau will walk you through the music theory in easy, step-by-step lessons designed to inspire you as you learn. Musical terms such as ‘notes’, ‘chords’ and ‘keys’ will come easily to you. For example, you'll discover the major and minor scales on a piano and guitar and the various musical intervals.&nbsp;</p><p>Familiarity with chord vocabulary will make you confident and comfortable playing rhythm and give you the courage to play with other artists. Learning chords is the foundation, as you study how they are built and learn to play them in different keys. First, you will learn how to play minor and major chords by memorising their shapes. Then we review extensively advanced chords, such as the dominant seventh chord and diminished chords. Next, we analyse chord progressions, relative keys, diatonic chord tones, time signatures in music and how you use them in different songs. Finally, we demonstrate how to transpose a piece to fit your voice, as well as tips, tricks and exercises to help solidify your understanding of typical chord progression and transposition.</p><p>A great melody is vital in capturing and holding your listener's attention. Songwriters and composers use them to bring their messages across and connect with their audience. The melody is the musical element that audiences sing along to and remember the most. In the final section, we will study the technique of finding and writing a melody and using the concept of a ‘hook’ in songwriting to catch the ear of the listener. We will enable, encourage and empower you to get those songs floating around your head for everyone to hear. This course uses both piano and guitar. Having some knowledge to read, write or play these instruments is an advantage but not necessary. In this course, we give you guidelines that will help you create, write and compose your music.
