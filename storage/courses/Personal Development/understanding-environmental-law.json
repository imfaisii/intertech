Sadly, efforts to achieve sustainable development and environmental sustainability are hampered by violations of environmental legislation. To help you address such violations, this law course examines the UK’s legal system and explains how it responds and is affected by different environmental issues. We then explore the main areas of environmental law.</p><p>International environmental laws and institutes act as the principal framework for international cooperation that aim to protect the local, regional and global environment. The course introduces you to the environmental aspects of international law and establishes the need for such a legal framework and the organisations that employ it to implement environmental policies like the Legacy Act that protects the Great Lakes in forums like the United Nations General Assembly.</p><p>This law course also looks at compliance and government procedures as they aim to establish common ground for the application of international law as it relates to global environmental challenges. We also demonstrate the importance of effective environmental laws and regulation enforcement for good environmental management. Human existence depends on the fate of the planet and it is critical that we enact laws to safeguard our natural world. Environmental laws offer a legal route towards sustainable development and green protections so sign up to do your part for the environment.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
