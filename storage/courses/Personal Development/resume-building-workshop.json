This course first explains what a professional résumé is and introduces the course instructor and some of her professional work experiences. Then, you will learn how to sell your concepts and ideas to fit into the position that you are seeking. In this section, we will provide you with options for dealing with your strengths and weaknesses that prevent you from doing what interests you. After that, you will explore the ‘four Fs’ of building a professional résumé.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, you will go through examples of some basic résumés. You will first be shown an ’unappealing’ handwritten one and asked to detect its errors. We supply some tips on how to correct these blunders. Then we will provide you with a ‘reasonable’ printed resume and guide you on how to make it look more professional. Explore some explanatory templates and be advised on how to change them to either education-based or work-based and learn how to add other experiences and certifications if you have them. This section will also cover what you should or should not do when building a professional résumé. Research the differences between acting, arts and performance résumés. We will also explain the new industry standards for an acting résumé.</p><p>The following section teaches you how to set goals for yourself. First, you will learn about S.M.A.R.T. goals and, as you progress and understand what you love, we will explore D.U.M.B. goals.

Lastly, we provide you with a list of things not to do or wear when attending an interview.
