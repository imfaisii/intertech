The floristry industry is rapidly evolving in the 21st Century, like many other businesses. So what do you need to know before venturing into the floral business? It's simple: you need to learn floral design's underlying elements and principles. The bedrock of every successful business endeavour lies in its ability to uphold and operate its established guiding principles. Learn how to combine different pieces to create an overall emotion or fulfil a purpose. Colour is a central part of any floral design - so give attention to your choices. For example, some colours are naturally soothing but others may irritate people. As a florist, you need to understand how colours relate to each other and work together, which guides you in choosing the perfect colour scheme for your floral design.</p><p>This course will provide you with different theories and practices of flower arrangements in different cultures. We commonly use specific shapes and formats to supply the preliminary flower arrangement. The traditional design work practised in varying cultures can differ in appearance and technique. Lines, symmetry and shapes dominate western design, while Europeans prefer different aspects and forms of botany. Eastern (Ikebana) style celebrates simplicity and symbolism. Discover the variety of popular flower arrangements, such as Carnation Balls and Autumn Rose Medleys, to mention but a few, and learn the step-by-step procedures to create each one. Research how to make the most attractive floral arrangements either for sale or for an event through the art of flower arrangement. Communicate with your flowers and apply your personality and unique touches to a floral arrangement. A vase should complement the visual appearance and underline the natural beauty of flowers. Find a perfect vase or create a container for your flower arrangement.</p><p>Professionalism is the key to success in the floristry industry. It is what makes you stand out. Learn the roles and responsibilities of a proficient wedding florist and how to make a wedding bouquet and decorate the ceremony and reception area competently.
