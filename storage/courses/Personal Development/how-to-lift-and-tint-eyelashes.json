Beauty therapists can add such treatments to their list of services to gain a great advantage over their competitors. Hygiene is a top priority with this method and we demonstrate how to adhere to good hygiene, safety and client record protocols, including patch testing and pre-treatment client consultation (which are legal requirements in some countries like the United Kingdom). We describe how to keep your treatment space clean and tidy to create an inviting and safe space for beauty therapy. This course is divided into two sections: eyelash lift and tint followed by eyelash tinting alone.</p><p>In the first section, we introduce you to the eyelash lift and tint treatment, starting with its benefits and safety aspects. We then examine the tools and equipment involved. The course demonstrates how to prepare and clean your work area to make sure there are no traces of makeup, false lashes or bits of glue left around the eyelash. Only then do we go through the steps taken to lift the eyelash and apply the first solution of the tint. Then we show you how to remove it and apply the second solution. The course compares an eyelash lift and tint treatment to a false lash application.</p><p>We then move on to eyelash tinting, which can complement your skills as a beauty therapist. We discuss the equipment required and how to provide effective aftercare information to clients. The course takes you through the initial consultation and patch testing, followed by the tinting process itself. We demonstrate how to mix the tint with the prescribed peroxide or other shades to get the right texture and colour. We then explain how to apply the tint, the recommended time to leave it on and how to remove it. The course concludes by showing you how to administer the finishing touches and prepare for the next appointment.
