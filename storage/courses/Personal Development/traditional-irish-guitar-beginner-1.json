In Irish music, the guitar may take a back seat to other instruments, but it adds depth and rhythm to any tune. In this course, highly regarded musician Michael McCague covers the basics that any beginner guitar player needs to know. These lessons will also appeal to anyone interested in learning how to play using Drop D tuning, which is popular in both Irish and rock music for the rich sound it provides. Through a series of interactive videos, with accompanying notes, Michael will introduce you to the basic techniques needed to play the most commonly used chords, along with some tunes.</p><p>The course begins with the basics of identifying and tuning the strings, holding the plectrum and strumming the guitar correctly, before Michael begins teaching you the chords, beginning with D major. He devotes separate lessons to teaching you G major, a number of A chords and B minor, all elements of the key of D. Michael encourages learners to practise moving between chords to build up their technique and speed. There are useful notes provided in a downloadable PDF from the resource section of the course. Once you are comfortable playing those fundamental chords, it’s time to master your first tune and the guitar lessons proceed to a reel, ‘The Maid Behind The Bar’. Fiddle player and TG4 presenter Doireann Ní Ghlacáin plays the tune with Michael teaching the accompaniment over the course of two lessons. The final tune you will learn in this beginners’ course is the hornpipe 'Kitty’s Wedding' and again, Doireann plays the melody for you to accompany.</p><p>If you want to be able to play one of music’s most accessible and enjoyable instruments, you are learning from one of the best in this free online guitar guide.
