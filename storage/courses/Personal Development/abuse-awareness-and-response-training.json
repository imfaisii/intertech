This course will teach you about the various forms of abuse and the circumstances that increase the likelihood of its occurrence. If someone you know is being abused or claims to be abused, it's important to take immediate action to ensure their safety. We’ll show you the steps to take to help a victim of abuse and the right practices for reducing the likelihood of abuse in the future. Mental health refers to a person's overall psychological well-being. It encompasses an individual's emotional, psychological, and social well-being and affects how they think, feel, and behave in their daily life. You’ll learn about different factors that contribute to the overall mental health of an individual and ways to improve your mental health.</p><p>In relationships, individuals with good mental health tend to exhibit strong communication skills, emotional regulation, and the ability to handle conflicts in a healthy manner. Conversely, poor mental health can lead to communication problems, conflicts, and strain on relationships. You’ll explore the impact of mental health on the quality of relationships, factors that negatively affect your mental health and how you can sustain your mental well-being. The psychiatric history and mental status evaluation (MSE) is a method for spotting signs of sickness and psychological discomfort. You’ll study the elements of psychiatric history and MSE, commonly occurring mental conditions and counselling interventions for these mental conditions. Providing support to people in relationships can be an important way to help them navigate challenges and improve their relationships. We'll show you how to spot relationship issues and decide on the best kind of assistance for those dealing with various relationship issues.</p><p>We designed this course for people who want to ensure an abuse-free environment around them and encourage healthy relationships.
