We examine the tools required throughout the process and explain how to use them properly. Before any procedure begins, you must prepare the client and remove their makeup. Next, you must prepare the client's face by cleaning and disinfecting it to prevent infection. Finally, you will learn how to mark faces for treatment and how to properly position the pen to inject product into the skin.</p><p>Aftercare is also an essential measure in the beauty industry. This step includes checking for contraindications and complications and explaining what the client can expect following the procedure. Our video lessons demonstrate the procedure on the face and the lips, teaching you how to achieve the best result for your client. We show you how to find out from your local authorities if you are legally permitted to carry out this procedure.
