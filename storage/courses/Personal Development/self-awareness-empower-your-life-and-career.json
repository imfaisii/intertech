Developing self-awareness is a key step in improving your life. Self-awareness is the ability to see ourselves clearly, to understand who we are and how others see us. This self-improvement course is designed to help you achieve personal and professional growth through a deeper understanding of yourself. We discuss values, belief systems, thought patterns, emotional awareness and more.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily life and forget to take the time to reflect on our own thoughts, feelings and behaviours. A person who is self-aware regularly practises internal thought and emotional observation in the form of introspection. Doing this keeps people focused on becoming the best version of themselves. This course helps you to understand your thoughts, emotions and behaviours, leading to positive changes to your personal and professional life. We start by introducing the concept of self-awareness and establishing its importance. We then delve into the ‘nine pillars of self-awareness’ and explain how they impact your daily life and career. We discuss the two types of self-aware insights and demonstrate how they relate to our behaviour and decision-making. We then examine the neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) model and its role in explaining the motivations behind our actions.&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding your beliefs and values is one of the most effective ways to become self-aware. The next part of the course covers the role of personal values and beliefs in shaping your thoughts and behaviours. We explain how to identify your personal values and beliefs and how to use them to make decisions that align with your personal goals and aspirations. We examine the ‘monkey-banana’ experiment to explain the concept of belief and its different types and show you how beliefs can be consciously changed and created. We also demonstrate how to identify your personal strengths and weaknesses and how to use this information to improve your relationships and achieve your personal and professional goals. The course then shows you how becoming aware of your thought patterns helps you to break limiting emotional and behavioural patterns and habits.</p><p>A significant portion of the course centres around understanding and managing your emotions. We trace the relationship between your emotions, thoughts and behaviour and explain how to use this knowledge to control your responses and create a positive emotional state. The course covers the six basic feelings in detail and compares primary and secondary emotions. We also provide practical tools (including the ‘wheel of emotions’ and the ‘wheel of life’) and techniques you can use to increase your self-awareness and improve your life and career. Whether you're seeking personal growth, better relationships or career advancement, this course offers you the tools and knowledge required to make it happen. This self-improvement course is interactive, engaging and practical so you can start seeing results from day one. Sign up today to empower yourself by understanding the motivations behind your emotions and actions and taking control of your decision-making.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
