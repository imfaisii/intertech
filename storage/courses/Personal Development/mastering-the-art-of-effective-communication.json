This free online course explains how to make yourself understood and appealing. We provide suggestions like where to look with your eyes, what you should do with your hands, how to appear confident and the ideal body language for different scenarios. Much communication goes beyond language and we show you how to make the most of yourself.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>When interacting with others, it's important to project a confident image. Humans generally care about how we are perceived and strong communication skills result in better careers, more attractive partners and ultimately a happier life. But like any skill, communication requires knowledge and experience to improve. Modernity also brings new challenges, like video chats and phone calls, and we teach you how to overcome such obstacles.</p><p>The course begins by describing how to communicate through the camera, whether you're recording a YouTube or Tik Tok clip or conducting a video chat. We show you what to do with your eyes, how to adjust your facial expressions for a video and how to use your hands to convey confidence. We then help you hone your vocal skills, which are highly valued across various fields and have a major impact on how you're perceived.</p><p>Finally, we look at body language: the position of your limbs and how they affect social perception. We cite a powerful analogy to illustrate the importance of body language in everyday life. Then we explore ‘low-value’ behaviours to help you avoid appearing needy or weak and compare them to ‘high-value’ behaviors that help you appear strong, confident and competent. The course examines the role of body language in social, romantic and business contexts and provides various examples of good and bad body language to provide a practical understanding. This course can help you improve your social skills by learning from a communication and body language expert.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
