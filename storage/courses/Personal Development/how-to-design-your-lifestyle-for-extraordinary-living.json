It is based on the book \"A Recipe for an Extraordinary Life\" written by Emilio and Samantha, the instructors about their real-life experiences and how they helped others make a positive change in their lives. We will start with an introduction to the course, the overview and a look at the syllabus. The instructors will also take turns to introduce themselves and give a brief background of their works and experiences. Then, they will share with you the main concerns that their clients usually face. They will explain how they developed a 'word cloud' that gave them the keywords of how they felt. Furthermore, you will learn about Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs to help you reflect on your basic human needs. A lot goes into how you feel as a person in fulfilling your purpose in life. With the help of Maslow's pyramid, you will be taught how to fulfil that purpose.</p><p>Next, having a great recipe for living an extraordinary life means something different for every individual. You will learn how to create your own recipe from seven life ingredients that the instructors used as a guideline for you to develop your own ingredient that suits your lifestyle. Their idea is that life is like a salad and everyone likes something different in their salad. Different spices, different ingredients, and what is suitable for one person may not work for the other. The seven ingredients are body, mind, family, social, works, stuff, and giving back. We will explain each ingredient in detail in this section. Their choice of ingredients was based on books, working with clients, listening to podcasts, and more. The goal is to help you understand and find your own life recipe or ingredient and know how much of each ingredient you need to live an extraordinary life. Also, you will be taught about self-care, which will allow you to manage your chosen life recipe or ingredient.</p><p>Furthermore, you will study the overview of what to expect when building your creation using the ingredients you have come up with. This creation is a practical exercise that you will do on your own or with others. The steps include practising gratitude, reflecting on how you feel and what you like to achieve. The course will teach each step in detail so you will understand how you can do the exercises at home. Also, we will show you some visuals to help you understand all the steps. Towards the end of the course, we will show you a real-life example of how guidelines in this course empowered a client to change her lifestyle to achieve happiness.
