Making bread requires that you mix the components until a paste or dough forms and then bake the dough into a loaf. This course explains each stage of this bread-making process in depth. We begin with the definition and history of bread.</p><p>Making bread may put some people off because they believe it requires expensive tools but this is not the case. You probably already have many of the necessary tools and the rest can easily be improvised. We identify the most important instruments used to bake bread. It is important that you understand the importance of some aspects of baking before you start. We explain how to balance the ingredients, temperature, timing and altitude while we address some common baking issues.</p><p>Baking requires that you carefully follow a recipe in multiple steps and we explain each in detail. Once we have outlined the process, it is time to bake your first loaf! The course begins with sourdough and then moves on to the straight-dough method. We then show you how to make some other delicious bread variants from all over the world. There’s nothing quite like freshly baked bread so sign up for this course if you’d like to enjoy this simple pleasure in the comfort of your own home.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
