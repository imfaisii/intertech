You will learn how to recognise the notes on the keyboard and play music from the start. We will describe many different techniques and ways of playing music on the piano as you discover that this process can be both simple and enjoyable. This course also examines the use of the free software program ‘Cakewalk’, which provides you with a virtual orchestra that plays music with you. We show you how to download some free plugins that create real instrument sounds for our projects. In this first approach to playing the piano, you will learn to feel comfortable with your hands and fingers over the keys as your fingers work together to produce beautiful melodies.</p><p>The theory of music is important when learning how to play an instrument. Music has letters, words and phrases and a specific way of being written. In this course, we lay out everything you need to understand the way that music works. These elements include notes, staves, music notation and more. We introduce you to a powerful musical tool called the ‘Circle of Fifths’, which displays information about musical scales. Music is a language and, just like every other language, it has a simple logic that we unpack. Improvisation can be used to compose lovely melodies. Accompaniment techniques can similarly be harnessed in various ways that help musicians collaborate with each other. You will learn how to play along with a friend or even accompany your own voice.</p><p>We then focus on the piano as you become familiar with its keys. Our easy-to-understand videos provide practical skills as you apply your newfound theoretical knowledge to playing the piano. Learn how to improvise on the piano by using the various techniques provided here. Anyone interested in playing music can benefit from this course. Your instructor has been in the music industry for over thirty years and has written books about playing the piano, informed by his performing and composing experiences. Building your confidence and mastering both the piano and music theory makes it easier to play beautiful symphonies and accompany other musicians.
