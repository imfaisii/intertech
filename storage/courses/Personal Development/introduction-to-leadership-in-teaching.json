In this course, you will learn the concepts and skills required to effectively convey instructions to a group in a way that motivates them to follow you. First, we'll introduce you to the teacher leadership concept and a teacher leader's key characteristics. Teaching is a form of leadership, and teachers must be excellent leaders to promote effective classroom learning. Leadership skills are therefore critically important for teachers since they are a crucial component needed to improve the quality of their education inside and outside the classroom.&nbsp;</p><p>Being a good leader involves entering uncomfortable surroundings, awkward conversations and discomfiting routines. Nevertheless, these steps enable you to grow, impact others to succeed and help you migrate from your comfort zone to the leadership zone. Teachers need to develop their leadership skills for the benefit of their students. You'll study teacher leadership skills such as collaboration, facilitation, planning and more. On top of that, you'll learn practical tips on how teacher leaders can lead adult learners. For example, high-stress levels severely impact teachers' health and wellbeing, resulting in lack of engagement, job discontent and poor performance. This course gives you an in-depth understanding of stress, how it arises and how to manage it effectively. You'll explore the roles and responsibilities of a mentor and the seven-stage system you should master as a general overview of the coaching and mentoring process.</p><p>How does effective leadership impact classroom performance? Influential school leaders contribute to learning indirectly. Discover the various ways teacher leaders can impact their students' performance. Investigate the main areas of activity in teacher leadership, including identifying the early signs of stress amongst teachers in the workplace. We'll examine the various ways of creating a healthy workplace and how to improve students' mental health awareness. You'll learn about Special Educational Needs (SEN), how to identify students with SEN and how to assist them. This course is vital for teachers, principals, educators and anyone interested in imparting knowledge to students. Students taught by strong leaders have a higher chance of academic success than those who lack these skills both within and outside the classroom. So why wait?
