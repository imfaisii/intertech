Early childhood care and education can influence a child's long-term social, cognitive, emotional and physical development. Early years teachers play an essential role in providing high-quality early education that helps to improve children’s development. Successful early years teachers require an in-depth understanding of the key principles and learning areas that affect childhood development and must know how to apply them to the early years foundation stage (EYFS). This course explains the philosophy behind the EYFS framework. We provide practical knowledge to help you perform the role of the EYFS teacher and appreciate the importance of early years education in driving a child’s development. We also guide you through the various paths you can take to acquire your Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS), which will allow you to work with young children in the UK.</p><p>The course then examines the EYFS learning framework and the UK government’s childcare strategy designed to establish it as the development framework provided to all young children in the country. We show you how and why children learn best through play and how EYFS teachers can use this technique to promote their development. You then explore the principles applied to special educational needs (SEN) teaching and the responsibilities of a SEN teacher. We demonstrate how to identify the different types of special educational needs in order to close the achievement gap between disadvantaged children and their peers. We guide you through the seven areas of learning to help you understand when to focus on each. These skills will help you to create an enabling learning environment and use different EYFS teaching techniques to keep children motivated as they achieve their learning goals.</p><p>The course is aimed at teachers but is also ideal for parents and guardians who want to apply the EYFS framework to bring out the best in the children in their care. The EYFS framework can be applied to make you confident that you are meeting the standards that all early years teachers must meet in order to ensure that children learn and develop well. This course suits aspiring educators who want to work with young children and has no prerequisites. Even if you're already familiar with the EYFS framework, this course serves as a refresher and keeps you up to date with current pedagogical developments in the UK. The educational sector provides many job opportunities for EYFS specialists and acquiring the necessary skills allows you to do what you love while earning a living.
