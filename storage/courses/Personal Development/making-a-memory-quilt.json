These frequently include diverse clothing and fabric types such as caps, formal shirts, pants, gowns, ties, bridal gowns or any lovely fabric you can sew. Memory quilts also include other elements, such as photos and stitched quotes or sayings, to further personalise them. These quilts help you celebrate and reflect on significant milestones. In this course, Louise, your instructor, will show you how to make various forms of memory quilts by guiding you on how to select, categorise, cut and sew the memory materials from start to finish. First, you will be introduced to memory quilts and shown some of the memory quilts that have been already created.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting with equally cut fabric pieces is crucial if you want to finish with a level, symmetrical quilt. A proper cutting tool makes the finished product look more professional. We will introduce you to some cutting tools and sewing materials needed to make the quilting process easier and faster. After that, Louise will guide you on how to make your first memory quilt project (pillow quilt). We'll demonstrate how to cut the pieces from the material's most distinct features and stitch them together by hand and machine while staying focused. The next project will be to make a T-shirt quilt. These primarily rely on how big and elaborate the quilt is. It can take longer to plan, layout and assemble a larger quilt since more materials will be required. You'll explore some tips and tricks that you can use to make a quilt from a T-shirt.&nbsp;</p><p>You must become familiar with several terms and approaches when it comes to quilting. Explore some of the best practices in quilting and how you can use them. We cover techniques such as chaining, piecing, quilt-as-you-go and more. The final part of the course will teach you how to deconstruct quilting materials and construct pinwheels for your quilt projects.
