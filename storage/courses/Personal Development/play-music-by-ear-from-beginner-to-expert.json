In fact, it requires a collection of skills that can be learned and improved over time. Having the right ear training and knowing the secrets behind the skill of playing music enables you to learn and play any music of your choice by ear. This course is designed to teach you the fundamental building blocks of music and how to find and play a melody by ear. It begins with the concept of rhythm. You will learn about pulse and how to find where the beats of a song lie as well as how to gain confidence in your musical ability while having fun. You are taken through a series of listening exercises and examples to help you listen to and play melodies by ear. Learners see how to find notes and the differences between high and low ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Chords and harmony give music a richer sound and add texture to a melody. Chords can sometimes bring rhythm to a song when they are played on guitars. The next part focuses on harmony and the use of chords. You will be shown the functions of harmony in a song and how chords work and enhance melody. Learners will also be shown which chords sound good together, how to play in different keys and how to accompany themselves while playing and singing. Furthermore, you will apply chords in different songs and figure out their progression and changes. As you progress, you should feel more comfortable and confident playing the chords while listening to the melody so that harmonizing becomes second nature to you.&nbsp;</p><p>The final part of this free music course familiarizes you with the concepts of rhythm, harmony and melody. You will gain an understanding of the timing of the chords by mastering the chord progression in the song ‘Hello’ by Adele. In this part, you will learn about the melody, key, chorus chord, verse and pre-chorus melody of a song. This course is for beginners who wish to begin their career in music as there is no requirement of previous experience or music lessons. It can also be very effective for music students who have only ever played by reading sheet music. Playing by ear is a great skill to develop and one which is often neglected in the classical tradition, where players can become reliant on having the sheet music in front of them. With the invaluable knowledge you gain from this course, an unlimited repertoire of music opens up to you. So, why wait?
