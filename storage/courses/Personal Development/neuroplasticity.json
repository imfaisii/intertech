We establish the value of ridding yourself of stress and explain how to do so. Most people associate the term ‘exercise’ with physical exertion but we demonstrate that there’s more to it than building muscles as we take you through various mental efforts designed to sharpen your focus and strengthen your brain. Most businesses market their products or services by constantly reminding customers about their presence regardless of how recently those customers chose to purchase them. This is because many major corporations do not trust people to remember them on their own. Should you trust your brain to fix or build itself, or would you rather emulate these marketing practices? This course takes you through each step of the ‘SelfieSpeak’ process to help you develop your own approach to ‘audio programming’.</p><p>Blocking out distractions and stress in order to concentrate is an important skill to master, particularly in our connected world. We introduce you to the idea of ‘focus mastery’ and its relevance in brain training and development. There are a number of ways in which you can work towards focus mastery and we show you how to cultivate such habits. We identify various distractions and break down how to block, eliminate or effectively manage them for increased focus. The course establishes the importance of improving ‘cellphone hygiene’ and email management while covering how decluttering can contribute to this process. Eating ‘right’ can also help to train the brain. Some people argue that it’s constructive to allow oneself to go hungry during the day. What do you think? TJ Walker, an expert, explains how proactive eating habits can aid brain training. The course then delves into the role of individual creativity by demonstrating how to identify your creative dream and craft your attitude to make it a reality.</p><p>Solitude is defined by a lack of communication with others and we walk you through strategies that can help you find time for it. We investigate the role of meditation and consider why doing nothing can sometimes be difficult. Lastly, the course approaches the notion of ‘deep workflow’, which represents the highest level of focus mastery. This course can help anyone who wants to take greater control of their mind and increase brain power. The only requirement is the willingness to learn and a desire to train your brain to focus on what matters most.
