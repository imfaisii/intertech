Or have you witnessed the commonalities between children of the same age and gender while in school or playgroups? This psychology course takes you through the various stages of childhood development and examines the key principles necessary to ensure proper growth. We kick off with an overview of what age group constitutes ‘early childhood’. The importance of these formative years in an individual’s life will be discussed. We analyze the characteristics of early childhood divided into age groups to properly understand their individual importance and dynamics. We outline the developmental tasks or ‘jobs’ that a child should learn by a particular age. The child’s emotional and social development at each stage of growth shall be examined as we highlight the role of parents in ensuring proper development. As a child matures, their physical and sexual development also comes into focus. We address these developments while explaining how to meet the needs of children undergoing these changes.</p><p>At what age does a child start sitting or standing on their own? When do they start eating on their own or brushing their teeth? Do all children start doing these tasks at the same age? We answer such questions during our examination of early childhood development. The development of motor skills is a crucial part of growth and we provide a timeline of motor ‘milestones’ to help guide you. Then we discuss the various activities that parents can do with children to aid the proper growth of these skills. We identify potential ‘red flags’ in motor skills development so warning signs can be detected early on. The course then discusses the development of speech and communication skills. We cite the research of various psychologists and theorists to determine the factors that influence a child’s speech. As a child grows, so does their emotional capability. The various ‘emotional milestones’ and skills based on age will be described along with theoretical perspectives on emotional competence.</p><p>Most people need social interaction to stay mentally strong and learning how to connect with others is a vital skill in the development of young children. The latter section of the course examines the various stages of the social skill development of a child. We analyze various theoretical perspectives on childhood socialization offered by scholars over the years. The course then establishes the role of various ‘patterns of play’ in early identity formation and socialization. We provide activities to help parents play an active part in the social skill development of their children. Key patterns of antisocial behavior are also discussed so that early signs of emotional problems can be identified. Lastly, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the socializing behaviors of children. This childcare and psychology course provides an in-depth analysis of the various stages of childhood development and the necessary principles and methods used to ensure a fulfilled and cherished upbringing for every child. Parents and teachers should take this course to play a healthy role in the development of the children in their care.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
