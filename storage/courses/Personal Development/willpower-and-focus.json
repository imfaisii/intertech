Has your planning snarled up? Were you distracted and unable to focus? Many of us face these problems, making us stressed and unhappy. This free online course shows you how to regain control of your attention and focus in order to achieve your goals. We live in a digital world where life without a smartphone is almost unimaginable. This device, a mini supercomputer in our pocket, connects us with the world, which is great when it connects us with the media to gain knowledge and share our views and ideas, but this device is also a major cause of distraction and loss of focus. We explain how to handle this and provide some solutions that can help you regain your full concentration.</p><p>In some ways, multitasking seems like a good idea: it appears to provide you with something to do when you become stuck on a task. However, it can represent a threat to work quality and individual productivity. We explain why multitasking is counterproductive and how it can wreak havoc on your brain. Shedding the habit of multitasking can help but isn't enough to improve focus alone. We introduce you to the concepts of ‘focus mastery’ and ‘deep focusing’ and show you how meditation, yoga and planning the day in advance can help you control your time and attention. One of the keys to success is to constantly polish your skills but how do you identify areas for improvement? TJ Walker advises you using his personal experience as a case study to help you reach the next professional level and appreciate the need to frequently update your skills.</p><p>This course can help you take control over your mind and improve the quality of your life at work and at home. Willpower is not built into your personality: it is a skill that can be learned. TJ Walker demonstrates how to develop your willpower to live a fulfilled life on your own terms. Mastery over focus can boost your creativity and productivity and anyone can benefit from this course.
