Their domestication process began tens of thousands of years ago when some wolves began to live in close proximity to humans. Dogs come in a wide range of breeds, each with its own distinct personality, temperament and training requirements. This course was designed to help dog owners and canine experts understand the psychology and behavioural patterns of their pets. We outline canine evolution and describe the different species of dogs before explaining how to foster your dog's cognitive abilities.</p><p>Dogs communicate through body language, vocalisations and scents. Understanding these communication signals is essential for developing a strong bond with your dog and interpreting its needs and emotions. We discuss how dogs think and investigate their various types of body language signals, stances and meanings. We then examine the patterns of actions that dogs use to avoid confrontation, deter violence and convey data to other dogs and humans. The course demonstrates how dogs express emotions to show you how to identify and address signs of canine suffering.</p><p>This course is designed for dog owners, breeders, trainers, dog walkers or anyone who has a passion for these wonderful pets. Owning a dog is a huge responsibility and there are several roles and skills required to be a responsible and caring dog owner. This petcare course explains how to cultivate traits like patience, consistency, compassion and a willingness to learn and adapt to your dog's individual needs. Learning how to understand your dog can help you to become a caring and responsible dog owner that provides your pet with a happy and healthy life.
