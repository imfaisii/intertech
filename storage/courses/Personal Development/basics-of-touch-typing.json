As a result, it is highly beneficial to your personal and professional life. This course will teach you how to enhance your typing speed and efficiency. You will learn from the start about the proper body position at your desk that determines your comfort when touch typing, such as relaxed shoulders, elbows kept close to your body and feet flat on the floor. After that, we provide several tips, including keeping your fingers on the 'home keys’ and repeating the letters aloud as you type them.</p><p>Next, we will look at the hand chart, which shows the corresponding key for each finger, such as ‘w’, ‘s’, and ‘x’ typed with the left ring finger. The course then goes over the 'home keys', the eight keys in the middle. You will discover that the four fingers of your left hand go over the keys 'a’, ‘s’, ‘d’ and ‘f’ and the four fingers of your right hand go over the 'j’, ‘k’, ‘l’ and ‘;’ keys. Following that, we identify the location of the rest of the keys on the keyboard, which finger to employ when you press each and provide numerous practising exercises.</p><p>Finally, we supply a selection of workouts ranging from simple letter combinations to sentences and alphabetical paragraphs. All these drills may assist you in developing your touch typing proficiency if you follow these basic guidelines, such as maintaining your fingers on the 'home keys' and writing each line until it is faultless without glancing at the keys or your fingers. So why wait? Start studying immediately and reap the rewards of becoming a faster and more accurate typist.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
