This course on 'Music Theory Reading Rhythm' teaches you a simple method for counting time in music. Explore metronomes as a practice aid and rehearse playing with two, three or four notes per beat. If you find it hard to keep time, the exercises presented here are ideal for helping you maintain a rhythmic pulse. Like any other music-related area, rhythm is something that you can learn. With the exercises in this course, you can master off-beats, triplets and the ability to count each rhythm in a steady beat.</p><p>Do you want to clap in time to a song and feel like a band member? Do you want to develop your musicality? For all of these abilities, a strong sense of rhythm is crucial. If you are learning an instrument and want to sound good when playing, we will help you master rhythms and play instruments like a professional. Although the first few exercises are straightforward, the material becomes more and more complex with each new level. By the end of the seventh level, you will find that you are practising some exercises that are very challenging to clap and count.</p><p>If you play an instrument other than the guitar, you will almost certainly need to learn how to read music.
