However, there is another option for investors to profit in the stock market: dividends. Dividends, in a nutshell, are a mechanism for businesses to distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders. This course will help you broaden your knowledge about dividends, investment platforms and companies to add to your portfolio.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Dividend investors are entitled to a fixed dividend payment for each share of stock they own and are paid out regularly, either in cash or more business stock, monthly, quarterly or annually. As a result, dividend-paying stocks can virtually be considered a form of passive income. Dividend-paying stocks have recently gained popularity since they provide a constant income stream and protect your money against inflation, making them appropriate for today's market conditions.</p><p>This course will teach you to discern between excellent and problematic dividend practices to make informed decisions with your stocks and investment. It starts with an introduction to several stock trading platforms to help you determine which is best for you. Following that, we will discuss the most common mistakes people make while building a dividend portfolio and how to avoid them.

Learn how to analyse a company's balance sheet, cash flow statement and dividend history.</p><p>The following sections will teach you to select the optimal dividend stock to acquire. Then you will study reputable dividend companies to monitor. Next, explore the stocks to add to your portfolio and discover the investing techniques to help you focus on profit expansion.
