With this free online course, we will introduce you to the Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) foundation. You will discover how the unconscious mind and the conscious mind interact and how to use them strategically via language and models. Understand how the senses, thoughts and emotions all relate to helping you to achieve your objectives.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) comes down to the conscious use of language to change thoughts and behaviours. With its focus on NLP, this course will help you realize you can achieve anything you put your mind to. It will teach you how to achieve remarkable results using our NLP master guide. What is the relationship between the mind and your thoughts? This course will help you discover that you have a conscious and an unconscious mind. We will disclose how these two work concurrently to help you reach your goals. Another vital component of NLP is language. How you use language and how it affects you, particularly your dreams, is fundamental to your success. This area of NLP is where affirmations come into play. The power of these affirmations has a positive impact on whether you obtain your goals or not.</p><p>As you work through the course, you will notice that mastering the power of the mind and language is inadequate to achieve these goals alone. This course delves deeper by teaching you about the representative systems, which allows you to remember the past (mental rehearsal) and imagine the future. You will learn, through experimental evidence, that mental rehearsal is a powerful tool for self-improvement. Everything you do, from thinking, planning and problem-solving, is possible due to this representative system. In this NLP course, you will also learn about strategies and sequential representations that lead to an outcome. The “New Behaviour Generator” is one of the strategies covered in this course. This strategy helps you to improve existing skills or learn new ones. Thoughts and language, in particular, are critical in the representative system or the process we use to achieve our desired objectives.</p><p>In the final leg of the course, we will explore different models of NLP, where you will learn about the Meta and Milton models. For instance, the Meta model will teach about acquiring information, clarifying meaning, and identifying limits concerning your choices. After receiving this information, there is a need to organize this information, which is called “chunking”. Chunking is a term borrowed from the computer world and means keeping information together. We then discuss frames, which set the reference points by which we judge how to make decisions. The way you look at a problem, in other words, the ‘frame’ you give it, can make it easier or harder for you to solve. We will cover the seven most common and essential frames that are used. The final topic puts all these concepts in a nutshell, thus helping you to set your goals mindfully and achieve them for an extraordinary life. Although anybody would benefit by taking this course, it will be beneficial for entrepreneurs, allowing them to accomplish their ambitions for their happiness and humanity.
