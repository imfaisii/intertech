Lesson notes for this class can be downloaded from the ‘Resources’ section of the course and used for further study.</p><p>Because every face is different, eyebrow treatments usually begin with a consultation session where we determine exactly what shape and colour of brows the client wants. There are sensitive health issues to consider and these are included in the dossier you and the client will sign. We will also analyse levels of shades and various face shapes since soom look better with certain eyebrow shapes and one size doesn’t fit all.</p><p>Finally, our video lessons demonstrate the actual procedure so you can see the step-by-step process required to create professional results. When pre-drawing the eyebrow shape, note the natural direction of hair growth as this will decide the direction of your strokes. We emphasise hygiene to prevent any kind of infection.
