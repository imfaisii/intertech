Start this course today if you want to unmask your identity, unlock your limitless potential, instil enthusiasm in all you do and live a meaningful life. The course begins with an introduction to the ‘multiple intelligences’ theory and a complete description of different types of intelligence. These include linguistic, musical, intrapersonal, interpersonal and naturalistic. Then you will uncover your top kind of intelligence by studying the characteristics of each, allowing you to understand your capabilities better.</p><p>Following that, you'll look into a few particular categories like favourite locations, activities and items to learn more about your personality type, preferences, cognitive functions and other facets of your personality. You'll explore the four temperaments: protectors (SJs), creators (SPs), intellectuals (NTs) and visionaries (NFs), as well as their job matches, which include leaders, negotiators, researchers and teachers.</p><p>Next, the course goes through learning styles theory and the visual-auditory-kinesthetic (VAK) model, which divides sensory methods of learning into three categories. Then you will learn more about your favourite and strongest learning methods by analysing how you best absorb knowledge using your senses. Finally, you will study 24 character strengths such as appreciation of beauty and excellence, bravery, fairness, honesty and hope. Understanding and leveraging your talents may help you be happier, more productive and more involved in all aspects of your life.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
