It teaches you how to make abstract motive images, such as taking a normal picture and abstracting the lines or preparing a tattoo. You will see how it can be done by hand or achieved with the help of a computer program like CorelDRAW. In this course, you will explore how to transform a normal motive into something abstract. For example, when you want to paint a pen, you need some references. So, when choosing a reference, we need to first have an idea that will guide us in knowing what kind of reference we should use. When it is a tattoo customer, for example, it could be easier because he or she arrives with an idea of what they want. If the client wants an elephant, you will prepare a motive of an elephant. If a tattoo artist wants to make some sketches and does not have this kind of reference, they have to choose some motives. It takes longer to design something fresh from scratch without using a reference unlike when references are used. Therefore, you will learn how to effectively develop and apply references to your tattoos.</p><p>Next, the material discusses the concept of abstract art. Learn about the benefits of abstract art as it gives you the freedom to explore the artwork and assign your own meaning to the piece. See how this intensely personal process enriches a viewer's experience of an artwork. When preparing a motive, the two main sources of reference pictures you can use are a camera and taking the reference photographs yourself or you can use the Internet. By taking this online course, you will gain more knowledge of the basics of CorelDRAW, including the main interface and shortcuts. Learn how to apply some advanced tips and techniques on the computer when using CorelDRAW. For a smooth learning experience, you should have a computer with the latest version of CorelDRAW installed.</p><p>Finally, you will discuss ‘intersection’, which helps you play with scripts and transform them into something else. This course refers mostly to CorelDRAW as the software is user-friendly and gives you full control over your graphic design. You will explore how you can easily create logos, business cards, patterns and tattoo designs. CorelDRAW is used by professionals across the world for designing promotions, making thumbnails, creating webpages and more. By taking this course, you will explore options on how to create your own abstract motives.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
