What if we could make money from social media directly by commenting, voting or even posting some content? Did you know that Steemit, a blogging and social media network, pays you to post and comment? Steemit uses blockchain technology and bridges the gap between a blockchain and social media. It is powered by the cryptocurrency token STEEM and the US dollar-pegged token called ‘Steem Dollars’. Are you wondering what blockchain is, the value of STEEM, where the money comes from and how you get paid? This course will help you understand the basic concepts of blockchain, cryptocurrency, the main features of Steemit and how you can earn cryptocurrency for free on Steemit.</p><p>We introduce you to Steemit and then explain the technology behind blockchain. After that, we will teach you how to open a Steemit account and build your profile so you can start earning. You’ll learn how to write your first post and the steps to promote it. With Steemit, you earn rewards in the form of STEEM, Steem power (SP) and Steem Dollars (SBD). These are the cryptocurrencies involved in the Steem-Blockchain. Are you wondering why we need three of them? How do they differ, and how are they related to one another? We will help you understand how these three tokens contribute and hold power on the platform. We will show you how to maximize your earnings by choosing to earn 100% SP or both 50–50 SP and SBD when publishing posts. Discover which one is the base currency and which ones can and cannot be traded directly on exchanges.</p><p>The course is a great starting point for anyone who wishes to know how Steemit works. With Steemit, there is no centralized authority, no ads, no selling of your personal information and no censorship. It works precisely like Bitcoins. There are no third parties such as banks, governments or exchanges. As such, there are no bank fees, exchange fees or uncertainty over government interference with the money supply. The best part is that you don’t have to invest any money. Your cryptocurrency stock will continue to grow due to supply and demand and so will your rewards for anything you post. Are you a blogger, content creator or cryptocurrency investor interested in earning money by maintaining a social presence? Are you new to the Steemit platform and looking to earn rewards for posting? Then this course is ideal for you. Start today and get paid to blog using Steemit.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
