We explain how the LSAT ‘Logical Reasoning’ test evaluates your ability to analyse arguments. We then discuss conditional statements and explain how they differ from simple statements. The course then examines the role of cause-and-effect theory in LSAT questions. Would you like to know how to identify conditional statements using various keywords? We cover such details in depth.</p><p>The course then provides strategies used to answer ‘true or false’ questions based on stimulus information. We show you how to evaluate the stimulus to answer the most strongly supported questions. We then discuss the cause-and-effect theories of weakening and strengthening conclusions. This part of the course demonstrates how to compare answers that weaken or strengthen the conclusion. We also explain how to use the ‘negation’ method to answer ‘necessary assumption’ questions in detail.</p><p>We then explore the ‘flawed argument’ questions and identify their role in the argument. We cover logical flaws like ‘ad hominem’ and ‘causation’ fallacies. Are you wondering how the absence of evidence cannot prove an argument? We answer such questions and compare the process of finding the right answer when both authors agree or disagree. The course then investigates the ability of ‘evaluation’ questions to evaluate arguments. We also cover ‘explaining’ and ‘parallel’ questions. This course is designed for anyone who is preparing for the LSAT and wants to improve their critical and logical thinking skills. Sign up to improve your chances of success in the LSAT and take your first step towards a rewarding law career.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
