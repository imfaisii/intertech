In modern tattooing, it is always good to have better equipment as the importance of high-quality equipment cannot be over-emphasised. Whether or not a tattoo artist is creating a small piece or a big design, it is important to use the best possible tools. The quality of a tattoo artist’s equipment will reflect on the quality of the tattoo they produce for a client. The client is then likely to tell friends and come back for another tattoo. This course teaches you how to improve and make your equipment. Learn how your main priority should be how the finished tattoo looks.</p><p>Next, we will discuss how big needles feel much better on the skin. You will learn how the less pain your client has, the more relaxed and less stressful the session will be. This course explores how, with big needles, you do not need to worry about blowouts or cutting the skin. An added benefit is the tattoo heals better than when you use small needles. You can only use big needles when you make your designs a little bit bigger. Discover how the bigger the needle, the less traumatized the skin is when overlapping. Questions are often asked on how to make proper blackwork. Making blackwork is the easiest thing you can do with tattooing. In this course, you will learn to make blackwork with needles. When it comes to blackwork, you will learn different techniques you could try like circles and zigzags. You will also study why ovals are often soft for the skin while zigzags are hard.</p><p>Anatomy and freehand go hand in hand. You cannot be a good freehand artist when you do not know about anatomy and how the body behaves and moves. With freehand, artists are provided with more freedom to express their artistic ideas that become evident once the tattoos have been completed. Next, we will discuss the speed and time of tattooing. There is no point in trying to be fast when you are limited by your skills, surroundings and workflow. You have to find a way to improve your time first without being fast about tattooing itself. For full sessions, you will learn why you should not take breaks too often or for too long. We will also discuss the importance of listening to your customer’s body, not their voice. Finally, we will identify the different aftercare procedures for clients. In this course, you will study how dry healing aftercare is recommended by keeping the tattoo as dry as possible. You will also learn why the first two days are crucial especially after big sessions. This course will help you identify your weaknesses and turn your good tattoos into great tattoos using advanced techniques. So, what are you waiting for?
