We show you how healthy habits can provide solutions to common problems. Although habits may seem like ‘small’ actions, they can contribute to your personal growth or decline over time. In order to build better habits or break old bad habits, we lay out the three steps in the habit-forming process: cue, routine and reward. Your newfound insight will help you to comprehend specific strategies designed to help you to optimise each step of this process.</p><p>While providing a strong foundation in habit formation, this course leads you through a practical assessment designed to identify gaps in your habits and their impact on the pursuit of your goals. We explain how to compare habits that support your goals to those that don’t and how to develop routines that help you to achieve your goals. This process creates a ‘map’ to help you plan out the action steps you will take moving forward. This course also delves into the role of your mindset by demonstrating how to identify ‘limiting beliefs’. Limiting beliefs can hold you back or can even restrict your growth or potential. For example, limiting beliefs such as ‘I will never be successful’ can prevent you from building growth habits because of the connection between your thoughts and actions. Developing a positive mindset with empowering beliefs is essential as you embark on your habit transformation journey.</p><p>The type of environment you build for yourself influences your habits because it contains the triggers that cause them to initiate. Your environment is not only made up of your physical space: it also includes your social background and your associations. Building an environment filled with triggers for positive habits increases your chances for success and makes it easier for you to make the right choices. Our habits represent the small actions that determine our direction so learning how to be conscious of our habit formation is very important in the pursuit of success. Sign up for this self help course to master the psychology behind habit formation and use a variety of strategies to build long-lasting healthy habits that drive you towards your goals.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
