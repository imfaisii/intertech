There are many animated roles and the entertainment industry needs well-trained artists to perform them. This course is designed for beginners by Stay Curious Media to teach you the basics of voice acting. It provides rudimentary breathing exercises and stretching routines to prepare you for performances.</p><p>By building a column of air as you breathe, you will be better able to project your voice properly and express any emotion without feeling tired. Stretches will also help to loosen you up and make you feel revived. We then examine resonators, which are elements that detect and amplify sound. We identify the different parts of the body that intensify the sounds we produce. Then we go on to focus on diction and projection, which involve how we control our voice in the space and in the moment to create specific characters and their moods.</p><p>The course then delves into accents, texture and tone. Your natural tone of voice is what you normally use to speak to people but you may need to modify it so that it sounds 'natural' for the character you are portraying. Finally, we discuss how voice modulation must be controlled by the speaker to achieve a precise goal that suits the script. Anyone can learn the art of voice acting but success in the entertainment industry requires some dedication and the right kind of training - which this course provides. Sign up to learn how to turn your voice into an instrument that connects with audiences through your creativity and skills as a voice actor.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
