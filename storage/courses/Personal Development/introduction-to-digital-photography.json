We explore the works of key photographers and the history of the artform to enable you to sharpen your instincts and take your skills to the next level. We lay out the ‘Rule of Thirds’ and examine the essential equipment needed for a photoshoot before explaining the differences between various types of image files.</p><p>Photography can be inspiring and lets you capture memorable moments forever. It can also drive messaging and enable you to build your personal brand. But just as importantly, taking a cool photo is both great fun and less complicated than you might think - as this course can show you in just three hours. You can use these skills for the rest of your life, for fun among friends and family or to start your career as a professional photographer.
