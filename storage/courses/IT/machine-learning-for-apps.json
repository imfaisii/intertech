The course will show you how to build a classification model from scratch to make predictions, using a world-famous data set to train the model. You'll create a neural network, capable of classifying human handwriting, and then use your neural network to build an iOS app, that can classify handwritten digits drawn on the screen.</p><p>The course also shows you how to use an ML model to classify photos in a custom-built app in module six. By the end of this course, you'll be able to apply the concepts and tools learned, to create your own machine learning models and apps for making suggestions and predictions.</p><p>Machine learning skills are in high demand worldwide as they can be used in many different ways: doctors can use it to diagnose diseases; it can be used to match people for relationships; it can be used to analyse costly manufacturing procedures. The number one reason for using machine learning in an app, may be that it personalises the app for the user. So start the course today and by the end of the week you'll have gained valuable skills in machine learning and real-world programming skills for using machine learning to build apps.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/1899\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
