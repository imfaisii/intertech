It is a game-changing technology and a considerable shift in developing software applications. Instead of using hard-coded rules for performing a predefined flow or identifying a pattern, we let the machines learn from data, decipher the complex patterns automatically and then use them for multiple use cases.</p><p>There has been a significant increase in the number of AI-powered applications in various practical use cases. For example, websites use AI to better recommend products and services to visitors and image-processing applications use AI to identify objects in pictures and video streams. There are endless practical use cases.</p><p>The concept of AI and ML can be intimidating for beginners and specifically for people without any prior background in the complex fields of mathematics and programming. This course will act as a starting point to guide you through the fundamental theoretical concepts of AI and ML.
