It is an important feature that helps developers and programmers to locate and analyse errors in Java. This course covers the basics of Java logging, including how to create logs and the common logging frameworks in use today. We begin by introducing you to logging, its benefits and its usage. You will learn about the problems associated with consoles, the flow of the logging process, logging levels, loggers and more. Explore the objects of the in-built Java API, such as handlers, formatters, filters and hierarchy. Discover the different types of handlers in Java Util Logging (JUL) and use them to receive messages from a logger to a target. Moving on from there, we will show you how to format log messages and set log levels to filter out log messages.&nbsp;</p><p>Logging in Java often requires using one or more logging frameworks. These frameworks provide the objects, methods and configuration necessary to create and send log messages to targets like consoles, files or databases. You can use many third-party frameworks to achieve this. These frameworks include but are not limited to Log4j, SLF4J and Logback. Which logging framework should you use? Choosing a logging framework depends on several factors, such as the available functionalities of the framework, the complexity of your logging needs, ease of use and personal choice. In this course, you will explore Log4j and learn its benefits and advantages over the in-built Java API. You will investigate the features of Log4j as well as its handler implementations. On top of that, we will demonstrate how to configure Log4j to publish logs in the console or any other target and add dependency of Log4j to a project.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, we explore the appenders associated with Log4j and different appender implementations given by Log4j, its layouts and their uses. What do you do when you need to change from one logging framework to another in real time? A standard interface gives us the flexibility of switching to any framework at any point in time instead of the direct use of a particular framework. This is where SLJ4J comes into play. Learn how to use SLJ4J and its binding implementation. Some projects in Java demand quick execution. This course will teach you about the fastest logging framework (Logback) and its essential functions, such as installation, log capture and execution. You require basic knowledge of the Java programming language, a computer with any OS and Java for this course. This course is essential for developers, programmers, college students, project managers and those who want to broaden their knowledge and increase their scope in the Java programming language.
