We'll show you the basic principles of programming your first PLC program. We also cover the advanced techniques that involve the Human Machine Interface (HMI), manipulation of internal PLC registers, and SCADA systems. Improve your PLC programming knowledge and skills by studying this comprehensive course.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Are you looking to become an accomplished Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) developer? This course is designed to help people with no prior PLC programming skills, and it will provide you with the necessary tools to create a complete PLC program. We will help you become proficient in data registers and internal relays. This knowledge will help you move to the next level in PLC programming and ensure that you do not use old coding techniques. You will start programming PLC like a professional in no time without going through extended code. You will learn more about contact symbols, which indicate an open or closed path of current. You will master the standard method of showing a contact by demonstrating the circuit condition it produces when the actuating device is in the de-energized or non-operated state. We will also explain why selecting control equipment for a specific application requires a thorough understanding of controller operating characteristics and wiring layout.</p><p>The course will introduce you to overhead relay symbols used to protect motors from overheating due to an overload on the driven machinery, low-line voltage, or an open phase in a three-phase system. We will demonstrate the method of expressing the language of control symbols, which is a line diagram. These line diagrams are made up of two circuits, which are the control and power circuits. You will learn that a PLC refers to a microprocessor-based controller that uses a programmable memory to store instructions. It also implements functions such as logic, timing, and counting to control machines. Why should you use Programmable Logic Controllers? This course will clarify why using a PLC system reduces costs, more flexibility, reliability, and compactness. You will use ladder logic, which is the primary programming method used for PLCs and realize its efficiency.</p><p>Examine the fundamental types of timers and their different uses in various cases. You will determine how to use master control relays in an electrical control system to shut down a section of an electrical system. Get the hang of Human Machine Interface (HMI) and build your first HMI program, which will work with your PLC. The HMI interface that you will create will control and monitor your PLC operation. Master the Mnemonic Programming Language. This language is an instruction presented in a short and easy-to-remember form without a computer. Finally, you will study the SCADA system interface with PLC. You will learn to program PLC using text commands and drawings, series and parallel block commands. This course will interest PLC developers or learners passionate about learning about this subject matter. Donâ€™t hesitate! Begin this course today and learn how to create your first PLC program.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
