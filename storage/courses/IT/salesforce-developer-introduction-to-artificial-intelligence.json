This function is the essence of artificial intelligence. In a paper published in 2004, John McCarthy defines artificial intelligence (AI) as ‘the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs’. This course aims to provide you with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand artificial intelligence and build such programs to improve customer service.</p><p>To begin with, we will introduce you to the concepts of AI. Then you will learn its fundamentals in the context of Salesforce ‘Intent and Sentiment’ (image classification). Next, we will provide a step-by-step demonstration of how to create a Salesforce developer account. Apex is an object-oriented language that you use to write AI programs. Discover the unique capabilities of this programming language and compare it to other languages. We will also show you how to download Eclipse Mars and integrate Force IDE into Eclipse IDE.</p><p>Einstein AI is a service offered by Salesforce that you use to develop AI programs. We illustrate how to enable and use Einstein AI in Salesforce. Finally, we will present three projects to clarify the process of building an AI program. This course gradually builds on core concepts before moving on to practical application through hands-on tutorials. The lessons are appropriate for anyone who wants to broaden their knowledge of artificial intelligence, amateur Salesforce developers or web developers who want to gain intermediate and advanced skills.
