Do you want to learn how to code or become a web designer and developer? This self-paced course teaches you the JavaScript programming language and the fundamentals of modern JavaScript coding. It begins with an overview of JavaScript. Learn how to use the Google Chrome ‘Dev’ tool to inspect and debug code as well as how to set up a live server in Visual Studio code for real-time web development. Discover how to link JavaScript to an HTML page in various ways, including adding it as a ‘script’ file. We demonstrate multiple methods of setting variables, including declaring variables with the ‘let’ and ‘const’ keywords.</p><p>This course will teach you some rules for writing JavaScript code, such as starting names with letters rather than numbers and not using reserved words such as ‘let’, ‘const’, ‘var’, ‘break’, ‘catch’ and reserved keywords. Explore the JavaScript data types such as strings and numbers and store multiple values in variables using objects and arrays. Next, learn about JavaScript functions, which allow you to define a code once and run it multiple times. Finally, we'll go over the document object module (DOM), which will enable you to connect webpages to scripts and programming languages, creating fully interactive and dynamic webpage content that changes without refreshing the page. We'll show you how to manipulate DOM page elements, add styles and forms, select page elements with query selectors, add event listeners to track events and animate page elements.</p><p>JavaScript, also known as the ‘Web programming language’, is a straightforward programming language that allows you to create dynamically updated content using DOM, control multimedia and animate images. This course provides you with hands-on experience designing interactive web pages with JavaScript and DOM. Learn about variables, data types such as strings and numbers, how to implement conditions, loops, and functions in JavaScript and DOM and how to add event listeners and manipulate page elements. This course is an excellent opportunity for a beginner passionate about web development who has no prior knowledge or idea where to begin. It doesn't matter if you have never written any codes or have no programming knowledge. Join today and become a JavaScript programming expert to kickstart your web development career.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4516\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
