This free online course will take you through various advanced concepts related to the C# programming language. Among the many learning outcomes, the course outlines how to work with objects and their various applications, and how to define a method in classes as well as how to implement them.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing declarative and generic functionality along with object-oriented programming and component programming disciplines. Microsoft heavily supports C#, issuing fixes and updates frequently. This makes it a more readily updated language compared to other languages like Java. By completing this course, you will have an in-depth understanding of C#. The course begins by introducing you to working with objects. It discusses value and reference types in various contexts which facilitates understanding of each type so you can avoid programming snags. You will be taken through the many features you can build into your classes to make the resulting objects robust and enable them to fully represent real-world, tangible objects. This course also provides an insight into the concepts of instance and static members as well as how to effectively build your own custom objects.</p><p>Next, you will learn about properties, which are crucial to understanding how to use classes and objects effectively in a C# application because they contribute to simpler cleaner codes. How do you retrieve information in the .Net Framework? There are three classes that you will need to be familiar with in order to retrieve data, which will all be discussed in this course. Methods in classes are important aspects of this advanced course because when you design a class you decide on the information that you will expose via properties. You will learn how the .Net Framework supports saving and retrieving information. C# is based on the C++ programming language. Hence, you will learn about the in-built support for classes and objects offered by C#. You will be taken through how to take advantage of attributes to embed metadata information to your assemblies and decorate the business objects in your application.</p><p>Finally, you will be introduced to the concepts of inheritance, derived class and members. When deciding how to design an object hierarchy, and how you make those decisions, is as much an art as it is a science. Like an abstract class, an interface defines a set of properties and methods that a class will implement. You will learn about the standard definitions and implementation as well as how interfaces work. This topic further discusses the benefits of using namespaces as well as the proper way of using them. Learn how to store multiple values in a single variable with the aid of arrays and how to retrieve items from it.
