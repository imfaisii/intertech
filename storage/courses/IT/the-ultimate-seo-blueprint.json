In this SEO course, you will learn exactly how to optimize your website so you can show up on Google’s top page. With search engine optimization, you don’t need to spend vast amounts of money on advertising. Instead, simply perform an SEO check on your website. Once Google sees that your website is relevant and trustworthy, it will assign you a better ranking so you get more free traffic. As Google is the go-to search engine and processes more than 6.5 billion searches per day, you want to rank as high as possible. Ranking high on Google search results will potentially drive significant traffic to your site.</p><p>Ranking factors are the reason you need to pay close attention during this course. Google’s search algorithms are constantly evolving, and you want to be ahead by understanding them. Algorithms deliver the most relevant content for a more satisfying user experience. You need to know that one of the most crucial ranking factors is page speed, from page load time to website security. How long it takes a web page to load will help your site rank higher in search results. Learn to monitor your site’s performance regularly and use speed-analysis tools such as Google’s PageSpeed Insights and the Pingdom Speed Test to understand how well your site performs. Mobile-friendliness is also essential. You need a responsive design where the website elements automatically adjust to any device and screen size. Learn how to apply Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test, which will help measure your site’s usability, and hopefully rank you higher on the search results.</p><p>Then, the course will guide you on how to compile high-quality content, which is unique and original. Specific content attracts more visitors to your site and improves visibility. Relevant and factual information, as well as answering particular queries, are critical as Google evaluates the content’s length, structure, appropriate keywords, and information. Backlinks, also known as inbound links, are found on other sites and link to your website, indicating your site’s authority on a subject. If a web page has quality links on its site, this helps rank you higher on search engines results pages (SERPs). You measure user experience on a site through numerous signals, for example, bounce rate and dwell time (also known as ‘time on page’). If a user spends only a short time on a site and then leaves quickly, Google will automatically consider the site inconsequential. On the other hand, if a user spends time on the site, Google will consider this site more valuable. Learn these valuable tools to make the most of your website. Finally, we will discuss site security. Site security involves all actions taken to protect a website and its visitors from cyberattacks. Thus, Google prioritizes websites secured by HTTPS. A site without one is marked as not secure and has the potential to drive visitors away. Since security is a top priority for every web user, adding an SSL certificate to your site is essential.
