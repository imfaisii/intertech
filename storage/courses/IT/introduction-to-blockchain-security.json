In this course, we show you the fundamentals of blockchain technology, its essential components and transaction protocols used by the technology to secure information transfer. In the blockchain, 'cryptography' techniques are used as security protocols to protect private messages so that only the intended recipients can read them. You'll study the principles of cryptographic security infrastructure and the types of algorithms used in blockchains. After that, you will explore the best security practices in blockchain technology. You'll learn about the uses and types of channels in blockchain and how they operate to monitor user access to data over networks. Blockchain technology is about storing data, essentially transferring trust from an intermediary to technology. Discover challenges faced while establishing trust in blockchain, the benefits of establishing trust and the popular industries utilizing this technology.</p><p>You must look at many aspects while performing risk assessments on blockchains, such as software and hardware, end-user and enterprise concerns. We will show you what a risk assessment is, some of its best practices and the numerous considerations to review. You will explore different risk mitigation tools and methods. Hackers and fraudsters can target and compromise data in blockchains by exploiting security vulnerabilities. You will study common blockchain vulnerabilities, including endpoint, public and private key security, 51% attack and phishing.
