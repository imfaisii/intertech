If your answer is yes, then you are in the right place. The course takes learners through the processes required to productively play out the administration assignments on their databases.&nbsp;The course begins by explaining the concept of partitioning. It introduces the learners to how partitioning enhances the performance, manageability and availability of a wide variety of applications. You will discuss the key terms and the syntax for defining a partition. You will also get to know about the partitioning function as a way to divide a large table into smaller, more manageable parts without having to create separate tables for each part.&nbsp;The course also outlines the various versions of SQL Server including SQL server 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2019.</p><p>The course goes on to explain the SQL data types allowed for null values. It discusses the native common language runtime (CLR) data types found in the .NET Framework and the simple ways of running native CLR data types that do not allow for the direct assignment of a null value. You will also learn about the outcomes of queries and logical operations when a null value is involved. Grouped data are data formed by aggregating individual observations of a variable into groups. The course describes the concept of ranking grouped data and how it is done with SQL. You will learn about correlated subqueries, a subquery that uses the values of the outer query, and the reasons why a correlated subquery cannot be executed independently as a simple subquery. Common table expressions (CTEs), the two types of CTEs and their uses will also be covered.</p><p>Next, the course explores the concepts of working with multinational data. It illustrates how to query hierarchical data using the hierarchyid data type. You will be taken through the issues with data types in SQL Server attempts to convert operands to the same data type. You will learn about the principles of writing more efficient queries and specify which operations within queries can be improved. The course highlights the areas that can cause performance issues, the different ways to resolve data when working on multiple tables and the EXISTS clause. It also touches on important topical areas around SQL Server over the years including the XML data type in view of the functionality and limitations in the previous SQL Server versions. Are you an experienced database professional with experience in SQL and looking to learn more advanced features on SQL 2014? If so, then this course is perfect for you.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/3317\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
