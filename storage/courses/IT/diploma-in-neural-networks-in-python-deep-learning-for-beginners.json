This free online course is your first step to understanding ANN and deep learning (teaching machines to do what comes naturally to humans). The videos will guide you through this process by helping you to build neural network models using Python. You will then use those models to make near-accurate predictions and use the libraries and data frames in Python to manipulate data.","courseOutcomes":["Describe the basic structure of a ne...","Identify the classification and regr...","Define Keras and TensorFlow...","Build a neural network model in Pyth...","Describe the basic structure of a neural network","Identify the classification and regression hyperparameters","Define Keras and TensorFlow","Build a neural network model in Python using Keras","Build a neural network for a regression problem","Evaluate the advantages of using the functional API in neural networks","Discuss the importance of outlier treatment, missing value imputation and seasonality","Outline the steps of variable transformation in Python","Describe the least square approach to linear regression","Analyze the accuracy of the linear regression model","Describe the basic structure of a ne...","Identify the classification and regr...","Define Keras and TensorFlow...","Build a neural network model in Pyth...","Describe the basic structure of a neural network","Identify the classification and regression hyperparameters","Define Keras and TensorFlow","Build a neural network model in Python using Keras","Build a neural network for a regression problem","Evaluate the advantages of using the functional API in neural networks","Discuss the importance of outlier treatment, missing value imputation and seasonality","Outline the steps of variable transformation in Python","Describe the least square approach to linear regression","Analyze the accuracy of the linear regression model"],"courseDescription":"<p>If you are a deep learning enthusiast, here is your opportunity to become skilled in artificial neural networks (ANN) within a short period. Without needing advanced mathematical or programming knowledge, this machine learning tutorial will teach you all that you need to know to build predictive deep learning models using Python and its libraries - Keras and TensorFlow. You will have the opportunity to practice as you learn by following simple step-by-step instructions provided through the video lectures. The steps are demonstrated to you and are supported by explaining the theory and rationale behind each. You begin by understanding the applications of neural network models and deep learning and their advantages. Then, be introduced to different concepts such as ‘perceptrons’, ‘network architecture’ and ‘gradient descent’.</p><p>The next part requires you to have some basic Python skills to see how the gradient descent algorithm is used to find the minima of a function to optimize the network model. You will be given a crash course in Python, where you will be familiarized with the Jupyter environment for Python programming and libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Seaborn. You may skip this part if you are already skilled in Python. At this point, you will be ready to start creating a simple ANN model by using a sequential API to solve a classification problem and then move on to solve a regression problem - this includes learning how to create complex ANN architectures using the functional API. Finally, you will learn how to save and restore models. If you want to dive deeper into the process of data analysis and preprocessing for ANN models, follow the next section of this introduction to machine learning with Python, which discusses the basic theory of a decision tree and the techniques of missing value imputation, variable transformation and test-train split. The classic machine learning technique of linear regression will follow. You will also learn to quantify a model’s accuracy, interpret the results of predictive analysis and find the solution to a business problem.&nbsp;</p><p>This course is for those who would like to pursue a career in data science or use the science of neural networks to solve complex business problems, or for anyone wanting to learn machine learning with Python. Due to advancement in data mining and computing power, business machines have acquired enhanced deep learning capabilities. Those who can harness these capabilities have immense power in their hands. It is no wonder, therefore, that they are much sought-after in today’s professional world. By enrolling in this course, you will leap in a direction that has numerous career opportunities in many data and analytical business fields.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/3443\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
