Docker addresses this by providing shareable, lightweight, container-based environments for developing and running applications. However, being a Linux-based platform, using Docker might come with a steep learning curve for beginners or programmers unfamiliar with terminal-centred platforms like Linux. Therefore, this course intends to provide you with a deep understanding of Docker and its use in creating environments.</p><p>We will begin by explaining how Docker technology works on the inside. Here, you will learn about the Docker Toolbox and the process for setting up and using Docker on various platforms. Next, we will introduce you to images and containers, the bread and butter of the Docker service. Investigate how to create images and web servers and master some helpful Docker commands. We explore a detailed exposition of the Docker Hub, followed by a thorough demonstration of how to run and customise containers.</p><p>Finally, you will learn to use your knowledge from the course to create a WordPress website in a Docker environment. Here you will be exposed to retrieving and using environment IP addresses and container host networks and will learn how to link containers to run certain services. You will have gained an enviable understanding of Docker commands, containers, Hub, images, networks, environments and much more in three hours or less.
