This free online Python course will hone your passion for programming by taking you through the fundamentals and more advanced features of Python. You will learn exactly how Python programming works, the different applications that Python can work for such as software development and mathematical computations and which areas you can apply them in.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Are you looking to advance from being a Python beginner to being a Python programming expert? This free Python course will introduce you to the fundamental characteristics of Python, which will allow you to use different types of data points used to program scripts and codes. Completing this course will enable you to use Python as a scripting language and compile it into bytecodes that you can use to build larger applications. One of the fascinating critical aspects of Python programming is understanding how to integrate it with other programming languages that you might already know. Python comes with an interactive mode that will allow you to interactively test and debug snippets of code and identify any issues that you might need to fix in real-time.</p><p>Firstly, the course will introduce you to Python variables which are containers used to store data values. Unlike other programming languages, you will find out that Python has no command for declaring a variable. Still, you create a variable the moment you first assign a value to it. What are the fundamental Python data types? This course will introduce you to categorizing data items, including data with a numeric value, positive or negative numbers, and complex numbers. You will learn about floats, which refers to any actual number with a floating-point representation in which a decimal symbol denotes a fractional component. In addition, you will master the more advanced data types that are available in Python. Learn to identify these different data types and use the correct symbols to separate the items or objects contained in them, which you must enclose correctly to maintain their uniqueness.</p><p>This Python crash course will then delve deeper into the various Python functions you will use when coding as a Python programmer. You will learn that in Python, a function is a group of related statements that perform a specific task that you can use when required. You will be able to use the built-in functions in Python or create one from scratch whenever you find that none of the available functions meets your requirements. These functions will help you break your program into smaller chunks that make it more manageable and organized. Finally, you will study scripting and libraries in Python, Pandas series manipulation, object-oriented programming, and understand how to start a career in Python. This course will interest students and working professionals interested in learning how to program using Python and is the first step in becoming an elite Python programmer.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
