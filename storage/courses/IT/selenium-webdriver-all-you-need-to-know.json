Selenium WebDriver originally developed the Selenium tool to test web applications, but its scope is not limited to testing. Discover the different Selenium functionalities, its scope in web automation tasks and the Selenium tool’s history. Selenium WebDriver contains the core library or API doing all the work to automate user interface (UI) interactions and web page navigation. We investigate how the WebDriver functions and the different interfaces and classes used to perform test implementations. The language used by web browsers is HTML. A browser knows how to parse HTML code and present it to the user. In light of this, we will show you the role of HTML in any modern web UI, how to invoke a web browser by running code in Eclipse and how to inspect a web page and its elements developed by someone else.</p><p>Locating web elements can be done in various ways, including searching an element by name or ID. We demonstrate how to quickly locate a web element using the right element-finding methods. Certain web elements, called ‘dynamic elements’, don’t contain static IDs, class or any constant attributes. Explore how to use XPath and CSS to locate dynamic web elements and apply a style to those elements. Some web elements are designed to perform special tasks such as embedded HTML pages, checkboxes, dropdowns and alerts. These elements provide content from another source, take feedback and display message pop-ups to the user. Examine how to interact with these elements, inject a simple Java function to invoke the alert pop-up, navigate through web pages and handle multiple browser windows via WebDriver. Web tables allow authors to arrange and organise large data sets into easily readable rows and columns. Analyse how to fetch multiple elements of a table instead of a single element and solve the timeout problem for loading web pages.</p><p>We have designed this course for beginners who want to enter the field of browser automation and start their careers on the right foot. This course doesn’t require any prerequisite knowledge or experience and anyone can enrol. We outline the tasks of writing and running test cases in Eclipse to help you follow every step and fix any coding errors should they appear. The content is divided into distinct topics and answers learners’ questions within lectures to maximise learning and ensure better engagement. Selenium web automation saves test case execution time and helps users test the working of their websites on different browsers. It is one of the most in-demand quality assurance skills in most industries, providing a vast arena of job opportunities for the experienced.
