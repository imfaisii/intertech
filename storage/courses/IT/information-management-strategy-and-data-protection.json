The planning, organising, structuring, processing, regulating, evaluating and reporting of information activities are all encompassed underneath the umbrella of information management. This course delves into information management and the strategies employed to handle it. Are you an employee in an organisation but don't know how to manage information to facilitate and improve organisational performance? We will show you how to utilise information to improve organisational performance, the forms of information, the difference between ‘data’ and ‘information’ and its lifecycles. Information governance empowers an organisation to achieve its objectives efficiently. An organisation's information governance is the backbone of its strategy. Discover in detail what this is and use it to implement the goal of an organisation.</p><p>The value of information depends on its significance to an individual or society. Learn how to measure its importance in the modern world using three coined terms. You'll discover the characteristics of information that will determine its relevance in any market before exploring what a computerised or manual information system entails. Additionally, you will learn to distinguish between ‘information’ and ‘knowledge’ and how it is processed. Keeping records in an institution is essential because they can serve as evidence for legal purposes or business transactions. For documents to be stored and maintained, information must be created and received from a source. We will demonstrate the concept of record management and how this can affect your decision-making. Discover the stages involved in developing and implementing any strategy used in this process.</p><p>Computers process so much information and data while we use them. This course examines computers' processing power and the concept of data redundancy and database management. It covers how end-users present and perceive data and the specialised data manipulating the language used by database management systems to add, change and delete data. You will learn about data warehouses, data mart and in-memory computing. Finally, the last part of this course will explain the five moral dimensions of the information age and the legal terms used to describe the exclusive rights given to creators and inventors for their creative inventions.
