You have almost made it to the finish line of creating your video - you only have to do minor editing, and then all you have to do is upload your masterpiece. Did you know that over 500 hours of video are uploaded every minute to YouTube? Knowing this, you begin to ask yourself, “Will the audience love it as much as I do?” and “How can I make my video stand out from the rest?”. If you have ever asked yourself this right before uploading to YouTube, you can be confident knowing that you are not alone. This worry is partly because you have invested so much time writing the script, preparing costumes, or purchasing quality products. In this course, you will first study how you can market your videos skillfully to attract more viewers and then how to use YouTube’s various features and tools which are aimed at improving the user experience. Many of the videos found on this popular social media platform can be for entertainment or informative purposes, but what if you could also gain an income from doing something you love? Learn the much-needed strategies and methods provided in this course on how you can promote your videos and begin to make a profit.</p><p>We start by understanding how YouTube’s search engine optimization (SEO) works, what SEO means and how it affects a channel’s popularity. It is essential to understand YouTube SEO and the efficient use of keywords because it can increase views and popularity among global viewers. Another crucial aspect to consider is, once a viewer finds your video and starts watching it, how can you make it compelling enough so that they stay for the entire video or for an extended period of time? This YouTube Video Marketing course covers the strategic techniques you can include in your content to help your video become more attractive and successful as well as more about YouTube’s recommendation algorithm and how you can use this to your advantage. The next key theme covers how you can target a specific audience i.e. if you wanted to attract chefs or home cooks, you would not post a video about cute kittens. Instead, you would upload a video about a variety of dishes from a particular country or culture. Towards the end of the course, you will be introduced to social media advertising and be shown how to create and add advertisements to your videos. Placing them in your content will allow you to receive an income and YouTube offers many options to choose from, depending on your budget.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone with an interest in learning about YouTube’s video marketing and its recommendation algorithm will gain a lot from this course. It will help video content creators, students and anyone thinking about entering the video production field because it provides insight into the techniques and strategies behind making a video appear more attractive, how to gain a higher income, and rank higher than other competitors.
