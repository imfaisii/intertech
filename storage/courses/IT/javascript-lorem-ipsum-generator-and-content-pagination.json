First, an explanation of Lorem Ipsum is provided and the setup for creating the generator is detailed. Several JavaScript functions and methods such as event listener, math random and query selector are employed throughout this course. You will learn to select page elements that are available within the DOM, add event listeners for user interaction and randomize content within an array using JavaScript. You will see how to use string methods and manipulate string data, and the steps to capitalize strings. You will learn the instructions on how to build Regex through a reference website and use them within JavaScript.</p><p>Throughout this course, you will learn to work with arrays extensively, mainly using JavaScript. In the Lorem Ipsum generator creation process, you will see how to convert data file contents into arrays and output them as sentences and paragraphs. And in the pagination build, you will learn to output array API data on the page. In content pagination, you will first discover the setup structure that is required to build it out. Then, you study how to make URL endpoint connections, conduct URL fetch requests, and launch HTTP servers locally. You will learn more than one server setup option that you can then choose from, should you decide to build your own. Discover how to create next and previous page buttons, and how to load and update API content by page number. Throughout this course, you will be learning how to work with various JavaScript elements such as ternary operators and conditional statements.</p><p>Explanations and step-by-step demos are provided for every code example that is included in this course. On-screen definitions referencing the Mozilla Developer Network website are given for crucial functions and methods as well. After successfully completing this course, you will have all the necessary knowledge needed to create a functioning Lorem Ipsum Generator app that accepts user input for selecting the number of words and paragraphs. You will also have the ability to build dual-versioned pagination, with the first containing functioning next and previous page buttons, and a ‘load more’ button that loads additional content to the bottom of existing content. This course is video-based and the source code from the videos is included as well and can be found in the course resources. The assessment will challenge your understanding of the course material, further enhancing your learning experience. So enroll now to gain valuable programming knowledge.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4161\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
