We begin by introducing the principles of manufacturing and examining its primary definitions and goals before demonstrating various manufacturing processes with examples. We lay out the manufacturing ‘revolutions’ and study some notable inventions from the pre-industrial era and the Industrial Revolution, including the Iron Pillar in Delhi, the Venetian Arsenal and Great Britain’s 32-pounder cannon of 1805. We also compare various eras of manufacturing, including the eras of mass production, customization and personalization.</p><p>We then examine various laws governing manufacturing, the relevant business models and the applications and impact of ‘Technology Radar’. We showcase some emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and machine learning, all of which are currently advancing the manufacturing industry. We then introduce the concept of Agile manufacturing (AM) and break down its key elements before establishing its importance and advantages and disadvantages. We study some core emerging manufacturing technologies such as the ‘internet of things’ (IoT), cloud manufacturing, blockchain technology and more. This course teaches you how to use these new tools to respond quickly and efficiently to shifting market demands.</p><p>The course delves into additive manufacturing, which is commonly known as ‘3D Printing’ and uses computer-aided design (CAD) to create products made from a variety of materials. We investigate the configuration of metal additive manufacturing supply chains and the phases of the additive manufacturing process flow chart. The course then discusses the features of the manufacturing and ‘industrial internet of things’ (IIoT), reviewing its components, platforms, implementations, trends and contemporary impact on ‘Industry 4.0’. We examine other important aspects of manufacturing technologies such as wearables, digital supply network, smart manufacturing and more. This course suits you if you have been looking for ways to become more proficient and established in the manufacturing industry. We can help you master existing techniques and take advantage of new technologies and methods as they change the face of manufacturing as we know it.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/3218\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
