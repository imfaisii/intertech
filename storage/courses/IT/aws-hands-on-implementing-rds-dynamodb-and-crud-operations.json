This course shows you how to develop these options with Python programming using the Boto3 package. You'll start by learning about the development tools (packages, integrated development environment or IDE, and Python) that will help you in your journey. Then, you will create an AWS (Amazon Web Services) account and understand how to prepare your environment based on your operating system.</p><p>In the next section, the instructor introduces the Amazon Relational Database Service. Become familiar with Boto3 documentation and create an RDS PostgreSQL DB instance. Youâ€™ll connect to the instance via Postico and then describe, modify, back up, restore, and delete an RDS instance. After that, the presenter introduces DynamoDB. You will grasp how to create a table and then describe, update, and delete it.</p><p>The final section goes into more detail about RDS. You will launch an RDS instance, verify the connection with Postico, build a configuration file for RDS instance credentials, connect to the RDS instance with psycopg2, create tables, insert, read, update and delete data. Finally, you'll study the downloadable version of DynamoDB. Become competent in creating tables, writing data (including conditionally updating), and reading data (including preparing and scanning items). The demand for physical servers is decreasing, yet the opportunities in cloud technology are expanding fast - so, be on top of the cloud, not under it and learn to develop with AWS.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4569\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
