It brings user interface design, coding and testing into a unified workflow. Xcode supports source code for the programming languages C, C++, AppleScript, Python, Ruby, and Swift. It includes the GUI tool instruments, which runs atop a dynamic tracing framework, DTrace. Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Xcode also integrates built-in support for source code management using the Git version control system and protocol. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and the program includes modern features developers find useful. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning fast. Swift is the result of the latest research on programming languages, combined with decades of experience building Apple platforms.</p><p>‘Diploma in iOS11 and Swift 4 Programming’ is a free online course that begins by showing you how to install Xcode 9. Xcode 9 provides a completely rebuilt source code management component, with seamless Git and GitHub integration. The ability to run multiple concurrent simulators, as well as wirelessly debug on physical devices such as the iPhone and Apple TV, makes it very suitable for programming. If you are working on a project, over time you may want to keep track of which changes were made, by whom, and when those changes were made. This becomes increasingly important if you end up having a bug in your code. But Git can also be confusing when you first start learning it. This course introduces you to Git version control and the terminal basics. Next, the material explains core data, how to implement Google Admob and Firebase. Firebase offers a number of services, including analytics, authentication, cloud messaging, and real-time database.</p><p>Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. Its algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, and speech recognition. It is also applied in computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. You should be able to apply this knowledge and implement other features of machine learning in your applications. Augmented reality (AR) describes user experiences that add 2D or 3D elements. ARKit combines device motion tracking, camera scene capture, advanced scene processing, and display conveniences to simplify the task of building an AR experience. This course identifies how to create many kinds of AR experiences by using the front or rear camera of an iOS device.
