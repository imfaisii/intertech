It begins with a discussion on the difficulties of working with large programs, passing structures to functions, and defining a pointer to a structure.</p><p>Next, you will study C++ member functions, vectors in physics, and how to use a structure to represent 3D vectors. You will also learn about writing the main program to implement the queue using member functions. As you work through the course, you will understand the various&nbsp; software components for building large systems, the modern version of a struct, and constructors - moving on to analyzing the concept of ‘operator overloading’ and declaring function members as private or public. The course then covers classes for graphics and input-output, and for disabling certain operations. You will also take a look at representing variable-length entities, the pitfalls of heap memory, and automated memory management (AMM). Finally, the course tackles implementing classes, the C++ standard library, and iterators for maps and unordered maps.</p><p>This free online course from Alison provides an in-depth learning experience for some advanced aspects of C++ with an effective guide to understanding how structures, classes, and the C++ standard library work in C++ programming. So, register for this course now and improve your knowledge of the C++ programming language today.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/2875\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
