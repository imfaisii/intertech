C# is a well-known object-oriented programming language for designing web and desktop applications. This is your opportunity to join the technological revolution by beginning your education with C#. This self-paced course uses a tried-and-true curriculum to teach modern C# and is designed for anyone interested in learning to code and develop high-performance multi-platform software and applications. We begin by introducing you to C#, then investigate its strengths and weaknesses as well as its popular applications, which include mobile games and desktop software development.</p><p>You will learn how to install Visual Studio Code on your computer so you can write C# code. We will also show you how to create a new console project and prevent the app from auto-exiting. Next, learn about C# components such as data types, operators and statements as well as file organisation. Next, discover the access modifiers and polymorphism in C#, how to define and use interfaces and how to create and use delegates. Finally, we will demonstrate developing a notebook app, a structure for storing page data and how to use delegates and constructors in the notebook. You will also learn how to use the ‘switch’ statement to extract secondary commands and how to handle events and use functions.</p><p>Exception handling is an essential aspect of programming and this course covers it in depth. We have designed this course for people who have little or no prior programming experience. We will take you from the fundamentals of C# to advanced concepts. The tutorials will help you grasp the C# programming language in great depth, allowing you to stand out from the crowd and build a solid programming foundation. It makes no difference if you have never written any code or know nothing about programming. Join today and become a C# expert to launch your programming career today!</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4968\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
