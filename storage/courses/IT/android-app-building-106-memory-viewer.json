App Inventor 2 cuts through the muck and allows everybody, including those with no coding skills, to design mobile applications from the foundation for free. The \"blocks\" designer is a one-of-a-kind tool that allows users to program by dragging building blocks together without writing in C language. This graphical user interface significantly speeds up development and makes for the ideal teaching tool for programming. Using visual drag-and-drop blocks like a puzzle, you will effortlessly learn how to employ the App Inventor's essential features, like the buttons of the user interface and sensor components, such as the clock.</p><p>Have you already come up with an idea for a new app? Maybe even some understanding of Android apps? Whether you have answered ' yes' or 'no' to these questions, this course will put you on the right track to creating Android applications. It also will teach you how to publish and keep up-to-date on the Google Play Store. Start the first module by learning to set the Memory List view and homepage layouts. Next, you'll discover how to programme the button to record a video and then save it on the phone using the picture, the clock, the location sensor and a tiny database component. The module's explanations of the layouts and key built-in building components, such as control, procedure, variables and lists, will be covered in detail.&nbsp;</p><p>By the end of this course, you will have created a Memory Viewer Android application from the initial concept. You will gain significant expertise with the App Inventor 2 canvas, buttons, arrangement, media and sensor components through the project. Discover how to programme tasks like control, processes, logic, maths and variable blocks that use the block editor. Explore the Android marketplace and how to set up the Google developer interface. Finally, you'll get step-by-step instructions for publishing apps. Think about uploading APK files to the Google Play Store, where more than 1 billion active users and +3000 new apps are published. This course aims to provide you with a solid basis for simple mobile programming, enabling them to publish their apps on the Android market. Today, anyone can make an app. Have you started on yours yet? It's time to put your clever concepts to work in a unique Android application.
