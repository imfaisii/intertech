It then discusses functions, hashes, file manipulation and the basics of regular expressions. You will learn about environmental variables, how to retrieve them and what data they contain, and be shown how to include other script files of Perl modules into your program. You will also cover the Perl module CGI.pm and discuss all the features and functions it provides.</p><p>You will then be shown how Perl is used to send emails, post forms on the Internet, and download and extract data from web pages. The course also teaches you about file manipulation, formatting text files using Perl, and the main types of Perl references and how to use them. Finally, you will delve into more complex uses of hashes, arrays, loops and databases, and learn about using regular expressions to manipulate text.</p><p>Perl was designed specifically for text processing. Its regular expression support is better than that of most other languages, and its built-in capability makes it a widely used server-side programming language. This course will give aspiring programmers and software developers the knowledge they need to begin using Perl in their work. This will be a significant boost to your skill set, and to your résumé.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/1588\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
