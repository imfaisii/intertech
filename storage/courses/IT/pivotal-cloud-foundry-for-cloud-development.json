Improve or advance your Cloud development skills by learning the fundamentals of one of the most popular PaaS web services in the market.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>The primary goal of Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is to offer the underlying infrastructure and environments that enterprises require to support continuous delivery of software updates, manage the application life cycle and develop, deploy and scale web-based programs. Enhance your cloud development skills by understanding one of the most-used Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) web services. We study multiple concepts and features of the PCF architecture, such as services, logs, analytics and build packs. If you are only starting, we will guide you through the essentials to develop your applications to Cloud Foundry (CF) from the ground up. These new skills are becoming more in-demand with large enterprises operating large-scale software infrastructures and multi-language like Java or PHP scripts. We begin with an overview of Cloud Foundry and then we study the fundamental actions for the CF command-line interface (CLI). Niyazi ErdoÄŸan, your tutor, will help you navigate the technicalities of Cloud Foundry architecture, services, build packs and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Cloud Foundry gives Cloud developers easy-to-use tools and efficient integration to run applications and data from the convenience of your web browser. Is Cloud computing hard to learn? As with any other language learning, Cloud computing is a demanding venture. We will open the door to the advanced features of the CF to help you walk through the development and deployment aspects. Explore YAML manifests and its configuration by employing the CF command-line interface. Research a Spring project development, including the activation of Service Instances and a straightforward connection process for binding a PostgreSQL Database application to the CF. Subsequently, you will understand the difference between the various Cloud solutions for businesses.</p><p>With the expansion of the Cloud computing business comes a diversity of options accessible for a surprising number of industries. Gain a deep understanding of the fundamental control elements available to manage your running applications, like event viewer and the log window. Many people still assume that Cloud computing works only as a backup for keeping the system running, but duties in Cloud computing services include controlling Cloud computing service models. These responsibilities include connecting external provider data centres to your company's network, developing a backup plan (in the event the Cloud service goes down), increasing network bandwidth and more. It requires basic knowledge of managing instances and environment variables so you can make the most of the offerings and binding services available on Cloud Foundry. This course will provide you with everything you need to design your apps from scratch and the step-by-step guidelines to develop and deploy your applications to Cloud Foundry.
