This course will examine specific penetration test procedures and techniques against both the Windows and Linux operating systems. Our objective is to help you appreciate penetration testing from a real-world perspective. You will understand how system vulnerabilities are exploited and get comfortable with hands-on vulnerability scanning methods, buffer overflows and remote code execution.</p><p>To benefit fully from this course, you must have two computers and be conversant with the Windows and Linux operating systems. We will begin by emphasising the importance of building the right penetration testing team. Then, you will learn about the open-source network scanner and how to take advantage of Nmap using automation. You will also explore the pen-testing exploitation process's planning and goal-setting methods. We will explain buffer overflow vulnerabilities by writing simple buffer overflow exploits and various ways to discover them.</p><p>Furthermore, you will get to understand the OWASP standard security awareness document and web application tool kits like the OWASP ZAP and Scapy. Study the Linux stack and Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) to learn how to hide some security attacks by making them as challenging as possible for any attacker. The end goal of a pen test is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of a client's security posture and relay findings back to key stakeholders to make informed decisions. To help you do this, we will finally teach you how to write a detailed penetration testing report. IT security professionals and administrators interested in protecting clients' systems from all kinds of vulnerabilities will benefit the most from this course.
