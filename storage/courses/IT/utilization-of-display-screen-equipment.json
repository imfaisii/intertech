However, if not managed properly, screens can be hazardous to employees' health in the workplace. In the United Kingdom, DSE training is a legal requirement for anyone who regularly uses these devices. This course is designed to help DSE users comply with the Health and Safety (DSE) Regulations of 1992 and to help them understand how to set up their workstations ergonomically to minimise the chances of developing musculoskeletal disorders.</p><p>We start by introducing you to the training methods employed by DSE users. We lay out the DSE assessment processes and examine the UK’s Health and Safety (DSE) Regulations. We study the responsibilities of employers and employees in maintaining the safe use of screens. We then go through some health issues associated with screens, such as musculoskeletal disorders, eye strains, back pain and mental stress. We discuss the symptoms, causes and treatment options of such ailments. The course then demonstrates the benefits of good posture and shows you how to protect your back when working at a desk for long periods.</p><p>This health and safety course then compares different types of workstations and explains how to optimise them for comfort, productivity and health. Finally, we study factors to consider when choosing portable devices like laptops, tablets and smartphones. This course is published by Course Gate, a company that specialises in providing online learning opportunities, and is taught by industry experts. Sign up for this health and safety course to meet the legal compliance requirements associated with DSEs and protect your eyes and back from the effects of long use of screens.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
