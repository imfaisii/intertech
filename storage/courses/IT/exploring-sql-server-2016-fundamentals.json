In human dynamism and development, database systems have become quite elaborate through our everyday activities. Vast clusters of information in government offices, libraries, hospitals, businesses, and organisations gave rise to various complex data problems, mainly involving storage, processing, reporting, management, security, utilisation and data availability. Solutions to these problems brought about the basic principles of the database systems we use today. These systems have also evolved to become computerised, harnessing the ever-improving power of different computer devices around us, including our phones and other mobile devices. Open your contacts on your mobile phone for a simple example of database utilisation. Recall how we stored phone numbers and addresses in separate phone books and address books. Databases have long solved the cumbersome usage of such methods.
