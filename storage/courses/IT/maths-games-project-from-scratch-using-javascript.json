The first topic provides a JavaScript code overview, going over the querySelector and CreateElement Objects. The JavaScript code introduction also covers Math Random Example and Array Sort Method, explaining how Sort can be randomized. This JavaScript game development course content also provides you with guidance on the tools and resources that are used in the game creation process, and the setup needed for creating the Maths Games. The setup consists of the Visual Studio Code app and Chrome DevTools accessed through the browser as well as the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN). The Game Variables and Objects are created, essentially laying the foundation for the coding that follows which includes the Event Listener (allows for a functioning game button), and the question screen which employs the JavaScript Array Sort Method and its Compare Function.</p><p>The following section tweaks and adjusts the game where you will learn how to use the Array Unshift Method, how to add an input area, and styling for the background color and text font. An Event Listener is then applied for checking the player’s answers to the game questions and the ScoreBoard Function is created for keeping score, with a CreateElement Div for outputting messages to the player. The second module of this course provides instructions on how to add Game Play options that the player can choose from to customize their experience. This JavaScript course then teaches you how to create a more advanced version of your game that displays all the questions on the screen at once. Another process that is covered in this module is the creation of a CSV File of the player’s score. The course concludes with a Bug Fixes lesson and a final review of the code, going over the JavaScript Functions that were employed throughout.</p><p>This course is crucial to anyone looking to gain knowledge of JavaScript code and its various applications. The code executed herein spans across the endless JavaScript code spectrum. And the result is a fully-functioning Maths Game Project that consists of two versions of the game, with downloadable scores for one of them. The code explanations provided throughout this JavaScript game programming for beginners course, through the experience of the course creator and with the help of the MDN resource, ensure that you receive a comprehensive lesson in programming. The detailed assessment section also tests your knowledge and presents as a surefire way of information retention. And since it is a video-based course, you can apply the demonstrated processes by yourself and benefit from an enhanced learning experience. If you have always wanted to try your hand at programming and are interested in JavaScript, then enrolling in this course is a fun and exciting way to learn the fundamentals of this popular coding language.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
