Although this course will focus on persistence issues, it will also cover Java's object/relational mapping. A particular focus will be on the Hibernate object/relational mapping tool. So why are you still waiting? Develop the abilities to build scalable, expert applications employing complex software architecture.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Hibernate ORM is an object/relational mapping tool for Java development. It handles problems caused by object/relational impedance mismatch by substituting high-level object handling operations for persistent, direct database calls. Hibernate's primary capabilities are mapping Java classes to database tables and Java data types to SQL data types. Additionally, it provides tools for data retrieval and query. Finally, it generates SQL calls, freeing the developer from manual object translation and managing result sets.</p><p>This course aims to illustrate the main principles of Hibernate. It starts by presenting the different ways of persistence, from the most primitive to the most advanced. Next, it introduces ‘NoSQL’, a popular term in IT that attracts a lot of attention. Relational databases are the most common form of databases today. You will learn about MySQL, one of the systems used to manage relational databases that are currently most widely used.</p><p>The following section describes the entities and the ways of creating and handling them. From there, you will understand the practical use of Hibernate and the configuration and its object architecture. A framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database is also studied. Finally, you will discover Hibernate query language or ‘HQL’. So enroll in this course for your best chance to master object-relational mapping (ORM) using Hibernate.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
