With its flexible smart assets, flows and ledger, R3 Corda enables frictionless data and asset exchange between counterparties using a clear-cut trusted protocol that meets regulatory requirements for privacy and security. In this course, we explain the basic concepts of the R3 Corda blockchain and how to use it. Firstly, we discuss why it was developed, its use cases and how you can apply it to other areas of businesses. Following that, you'll study the R3 Corda's project Excalibur and how Corda intersects business requirements. Additionally, we distinguish between R3 Corda and R3 Corda Enterprise.</p><p>As a distributed database, R3 Corda stores information electronically in digital format and shares data among points in its network known as 'nodes’. You'll study the processes of these nodes, how they communicate and the varieties of services they provide, such as pluggable notary services, oracles services, scheduler services, network map services and more. You'll learn about the Corda network and what the Corda business is all about. We break down complex terminologies in the R3 Corda blockchain such as ‘CorDapps’ and ‘smart contracts’ and examine key concepts such as state objects, consensus, flows, doorman and more. R3 Corda supports, records and maintains various financial transactions across its decentralized network, which are traceable and unalterable. You'll learn about transactions, the types in R3 Corda, the changes that facilitate transactions and the conditions to meet before you can carry out a transaction proposal.</p><p>The next section of this course covers the states of transactions in R3 Corda and the properties of the ledger. You'll explore the distributed applications in Corda and the goals of CorDapps in the ledger. Many blockchains are developed with different programming languages, which you will investigate. Blockchain applications require testing frameworks to validate functionality. We demonstrate how to use the DemoBench application to launch local nodes and experiment. The last section of this course will discuss how to become a certified blockchain specialist through the Certified Blockchain Solution Architect (CBSA) examination. This course is for learners with basic knowledge of this technology but still lack experience with blockchain technology.
