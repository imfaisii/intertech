Information is spread across various and sometimes complex sources such as Excel sheets, SQL files or even websites. And, quite often, it requires adequate cleaning, wrangling, and manipulation before and during analysis. There are a number of data analytic tools available to individuals or organizations who intend to do data analysis but not many are free and easy to use. MicroStrategy Desktop is widely used because it can connect with existing enterprise apps and systems, is a useful tool for solving big data-related issues, is user-friendly and offers advanced and predictive analytics features. Although there is a lot more than the user stands to learn with this program by practice, this online practical course comprehensively covers a general lifecycle of how the program can be used to produce relevant insight for businesses or individuals.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
