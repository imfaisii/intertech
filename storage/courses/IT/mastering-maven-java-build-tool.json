It follows the convention over configuration principle, letting you manage your projects with little to no extra effort. We will show you how to download and install Maven on Mac/Linux and Windows operating systems by following simple steps. Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Maven and requires no explicit Maven plugin. Discover how to create a simple project on Maven using Eclipse and understand the default behaviour and settings that exist when you don’t provide any custom configuration. During the development of an application, we often require libraries created by someone else. You will discover the dependency of Maven projects on these libraries, the dependency range, the main scopes of a dependency and how Maven provides flexibility to resolve any dependency conflicts should they arise.</p><p>The Maven ‘build lifecycle’ is a collection of multiple phases/steps that constantly run in order. You will learn about different goals of using Maven, standard build lifecycles and their respective functions. Explore how to deploy a Java application onto a server by following the correct steps. In Maven, a project is configured and managed with the help of a single file called ‘POM.xml’. Investigate how to customise the default behaviour of Maven by altering POM.xml. Understand the concept of child POM, super POM and the merger of these POMs. Maven works with plugins and each plugin is bound to a particular phase. There are different phases connected to a specific plugin and its goal when running a lifecycle. Acquire the knowledge of plugin tags, a list of plugins and how to use and configure custom plugins.</p><p>We have designed this course for IT and computer science students or anyone wanting to learn about a build automation tool for managing projects. This course requires no prerequisite knowledge, skills or experience and anyone can enrol. Are you someone who finds computer codes and commands confusing? We have divided this course into easily understandable lectures. It helps you with the necessary executable codes and commands, making it easier to set up a hierarchy of tasks simply and efficiently. Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and Maven happens to be the most commonly used build tool for Java-based projects. Having equipped yourself with the knowledge and expertise in this dynamic project management tool, you will be better able to secure a position as an IT professional in the job market.
