For instance, the software's features and expectations can grow over time, resulting in design issues such as flaws and bugs. In this course, we start by outlining the design principles to ensure that you have the opportunity to look at all possible approaches in secure software, allowing you to adhere to best practices and prevent many potential security flaws that could arise and cause significant harm. We will then learn about attack surface evaluation and the different types of threats in threat modeling. We will discuss the attack tree, secure design review, risk management, mitigation strategies, and software risk monitoring as you progress. Continuous monitoring is needed to evaluate the project environment for changes.</p><p>You will also learn about software security architecture, an enterprise-wide development strategy that addresses precise recommendations for how, when, and where to implement security measures. We will also show you how to rank your risks based on an evaluation; during this process, you will learn to distinguish between qualitative and quantitative prioritization. Then, we will show you how to use frameworks for security architecture like TOGAF and CMMI. Understanding the common concerns with software vulnerabilities is very crucial in the implementation phase of software security. This course will explore the most common software security vulnerabilities and risks. Then we will detail the security control implementation processes as well as factors to consider when determining your choice of security controls.</p><p>In software development, security is crucial since a lack of it might expose all the vulnerabilities to the public. This allows attackers to carry out dangerous activities on such insecure software. This course aims to impart knowledge on how to test for security flaws during the design process, the significance of incorporating security early in the software lifecycle, and the repercussions of failing to install strong security measures for your product. This course is suitable if you are a software engineer or developer or want to study the principles of IT security based on software development.
