Do you want to expand your competencies by learning Terraform, the most popular infrastructure configuration management solution? Then this course has been designed especially for you. You will learn about using Terraform code and how to create an Amazon Web Services framework, a recommended network design that is highly available, scalable, fault-tolerant, and resilient.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>This course aims to make you proficient in working with AWS using Terraform for various AWS resources on VPC and EC2 instances. It starts by introducing development tools and the environment you will build in. First, you will explore AWS CLI as a starting point for managing an AWS account. You will learn about Python, the primary language for interacting with AWS, and PyCharm, a powerful JetBrains IDE for Python development. Boto3 is a fantastic AWS library that Amazon supports. It is powerful to have an AWS account where you can play with AWS resources and learn how to build them. You will log in to the AWS Management Console and tour some of its most crucial features. After you create a development user for an account on AWS and obtain credentials, you will discover how to use these credentials to build up an environment with CLI for interaction.</p><p>The next section of the course explains how to install tools and set up an environment on Windows or MAC OS. Discover the procedures for installing Terraform, IntelliJ Plugin, Python 3, Pip, AWS SDK (CLI) and Boto3 on both operating systems. We describe how to set up environment variables for Terraform deployments and configure IDE to use Terraform efficiently by installing a Terraform plugin that will highlight the syntax and auto-complete in detail. In addition, you will get a crash course on Terraform, where you will learn everything you need to know about setting up this infrastructure, its features and commands, language syntax, dependencies and states. After setting everything up, you will develop some Terraform code to put the architecture into action. First, we describe setting up a remote state and getting a key pair to connect to the instances you launch. Next, you will learn how to create the virtual private cloud (VPC) environment. To achieve high availability requirements, split your private and public subnets across three separate availability zones within a region.</p><p>The course then explores how to manage the routing between the resources inside VPC by creating private and public route tables. Connect an Internet gateway (IGW) to your VPC for use with public subnets, allowing those subnets' resources to access and receive public Internet traffic. A private subnet also requires Internet access, but solely for outgoing connections from the resources in private subnets. By launching and connecting a NAT gateway to the private route table, you'll be able to meet this criterion. After configuring the low-level networking infrastructure, you will explore how to implement the launch configurations for public and private EC2 instances launched through auto-scaling groups. In addition, you will learn how to implement the auto-scaling groups using these launch configurations, create an SNS topic and subscribe to it to get real-time notifications on what is happening with your instances and infrastructure. Finally, you will discover how to verify your setup and test the whole architecture.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
