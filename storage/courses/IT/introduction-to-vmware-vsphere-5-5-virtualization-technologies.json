Formerly known as VMware Infrastructure 4, VMware vSphere is VMware's cloud computing operating system which consists of ESXi, a Type 1 hypervisor, and other important features to ensure that the virtual servers are running perfectly. Additionally, it serves as a platform for managing and implementing virtual machine (VM) infrastructure and is extremely useful as a large number of modern businesses nowadays depend on virtualization to help them scale up and cut hardware costs. In this course, you will be taken through the features of VMware as a virtualization platform where you will learn about resource manipulation, automated administration using PowerCLI, and VM creation.</p><p>This VMWare course will teach you the various components of VMware virtualization, how they work and how VM is the base unit of VMware virtualization as well as the command-line interface (CLI) for virtual machine management and how to configure virtual machine settings using the vSphere Client. The next section of content covers how to use other programs and the vSphere Web Services software development kit to configure VMs, how to create vSphere distributed switches and vSphere standard switches, and to configure networking for VMware vSphere. Some other key themes include vSphere Networking, how to use standard switches for providing network connectivity to hosts and VMs and how you can create network devices (abstracted) called vSphere standard switches.</p><p>Virtualization software allows you to run programs and deploy apps with two or more operating systems using an abstraction layer, gives a more structured utilization of computer hardware, and allows public and private cloud providers to serve even more users. Virtualization products are now an important part of many organizations and in this free online course, we detail the features of vSphere that make virtualization a practical, cost-efficient technology, and you can learn the skills required to administer VMs through vSphere 5.5 by enrolling in this free online course.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/3625\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
