This course outlines the concepts and initial requirements for ensuring such. We begin by explaining the concept of the “CIA triad,” the three principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, which are necessary for the software security space. You will learn how to manage availability, safeguard different sorts of data, and maintain confidentiality and integrity in software. You will then discover how to use authentication authorization availability to restrict access to and manage computer resources. You will also learn how to manage software encryption. After that, we will research the least privilege principle, least common mechanism, defense in depth, separation of duties, and single point of failure.</p><p>When collecting requirements for software development, security should be a key consideration. We will teach you the difference between functional and non-functional requirements. We will explore software security requirements and how to distinguish the different types of requirements, the process of eliciting security requirements, policy decomposition, data classification, subject/object matric and use case, and misuse case. We explain the traceability matrix of the regulatory, industry, legal, privacy, and security requirements.</p><p>Secure software guarantees smooth, end-to-end information management from user interactions to higher-level decision-making. The first step to software security is to understand the concepts and requirements that ensure the program is ready for assaults or anything else that might try to bring it down. By taking this course, you will acquire the knowledge that will assist you in understanding the best practices for software development. Webmasters, network administrators, or anyone who wishes to venture into software development will find this course fascinating.
