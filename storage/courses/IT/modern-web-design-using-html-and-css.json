Barely a day goes by without your visiting a web page. While this has meant a rise in the demand for web developers, many interested individuals are discouraged as they are unsure where to begin. This course makes building websites easy. We will teach you to create a fully-functional, modern-looking website using HTML and CSS, the foundational blocks of web design. We begin by explaining HTML and the general structure of HTML code.</p><p>HTML defines the general structure of a webpage and you will learn to use its elements, also called ‘tags’, necessary to add and manipulate webpage components. We explore ‘div’, ‘span’, ‘paragraph’, ‘anchor’, ‘self-closing’ and other tags. Discover how to add images, lists, tables and use modern ‘semantic’ tags to design web pages. We will put all this knowledge together to help you create your first fully functional website. We will introduce you to CSS, used to style the components added using HTML.</p><p>The course will investigate CSS syntax and manipulate font and background colours. We will present the ‘box model’: the basis for applying styling to webpage elements and changing the values of properties like the display, position and margin properties. These alter the appearance of your webpage components. Finally, you will learn to use the ‘float’, ‘flex’ and ‘grid’ methods to design responsive websites that look superior on any screen size.
