This course explores the basic concepts of RESTful API architecture and provides a detailed step-by-step guide on creating your own API platform. With a mock pet store application as an example, you will learn all the fundamentals of RESTful API designs and industry-standard and best practices for API architectures.</p><p>We will define the terms ‘API’ and ‘REST’ before delving into the six requirements of the REST design. We will also cover the Docker client, the Flask pluggable ‘view’ library, Postman and the installation and use of these tools. Furthermore, you will learn about the different HTTP status codes and how to set up Bcrypt and test tokens for your endpoints. Finally, investigate the JSON Schema library and study how to set up and test pagination on your API system.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will have a deep knowledge of the rules governing APIs and the ability to design, build and develop your own RESTful API platforms. This course contains at least four hours of video and downloadable source codes. It is published by Stone River eLearning, who provides high-quality online training courses for individuals, companies and educational institutions.
