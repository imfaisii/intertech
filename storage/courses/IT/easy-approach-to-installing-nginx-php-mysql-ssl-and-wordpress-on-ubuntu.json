This free online course will introduce you to easy steps to install and secure phpMyAdmin within this environment. With complete step-by-step guidance, we will show you how to install NGINX on a DigitalOcean droplet or any virtual server of your choice. The course will also introduce you to NGINX and Apache and explain the key differences between Apache and NGINX. We will outline the unique features and benefits of NGINX. The temporary disk is lost after you redeploy a VM, and dynamic IP addresses associated with the virtual network interface are updated. In this course, you will learn how to deploy a virtual server and install NGINX properly. We will explain how to apply a floating I and execute command lines directly to the server. Also, learn how to update the server package index.</p><p>MySQL is a relational database management system based on SQL â€“ Structured Query Language. The application is used for various purposes, including data warehousing, e-commerce, and logging applications. The most common use for MySQL, however, is for a web database. You will learn how to install PhpMyAdmin, to generate and serve dynamic content. Renaming a database cannot be performed directly through the phpMyAdmin area due to a lack of privileges for the user. You will discover how to secure PhpMyAdmin properly and how to test the Php configuration. Using a domain name to identify a location on the Internet rather than the numeric IP address makes it easier to remember and type web addresses. We will show you how to set up a domain name to point to the NGINX server. You will also learn how to configure your DNS zone file with DigitalOcean. We will guide you through the steps to modify the NGINX block configuration file and explain the process of securing the Domain name using the SSL certificate.</p><p>Finally, there are significant security considerations when using software like phpMyAdmin. While many users need the functionality of a database management system like MySQL, they may not feel comfortable interacting with the system solely from the MySQL prompt. This is where PhpMyAdmin can make a difference because it was created so that users can interact with MySQL through a web interface. WordPress contains plugin architecture and a template system, so you can customize any website to fit your business, blog, portfolio, or online store. This course also outlines the benefits and features of WordPress. You will learn how to create a database and create MySQL accounts that you will use specifically for administering and operating the new database. We will also outline the steps to install Php extensions that are used for WordPress. Learning this will teach you how to make adjustments to the default block configuration file. You will also discover how to make changes to the WordPress configuration file to ensure it works correctly. This course is valuable for web designers and IT specialists.
