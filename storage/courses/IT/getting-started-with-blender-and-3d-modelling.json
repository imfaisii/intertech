We explain the core concepts of 3D modelling using interactive worksheets to make the learning process easy and enjoyable. This course outlines all the key steps involved in 3D modelling.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Nowadays, 3D modelling is used in a variety of industries to showcase their products, thus opening profitable benefits for every organisation and business. For this reason, Harsh and Cloudia Digital Imaging and Design have created this easy-to-follow course explaining Blender, its advantages and the correct workflow for the Alison platform. First, it briefly discusses the interface topics like the Blender splash screen and basic interface navigation. Next, we will explain the 3D space in Blender by manipulating basic 3D objects using Transformation tools followed by the core concepts of 3D modelling like ‘edit/object’ mode, selection methods and essential tools to manoeuvre the vertex, face and edges of a 3D object.</p><p>All the fundamental tools for 3D modelling like extrude, inset, loop cut, modifiers and non-destructive workflows are explained in a clear, precise and straightforward method for an absolute beginner to understand. We will then apply the concepts learned to model a realistic portable speaker from scratch, which will lead us to the industry-standard physically based rendering (PBR) workflow to apply materials using the Blender shader editor. We follow this with a quick lighting and rendering session where we will learn the three-point lighting technique.</p><p>This course is a unique opportunity for students to learn the fundamentals of 3D modelling tools and techniques with practical methods starting from the basics of Blender. We have included everything that a Blender beginner requires from start to end. Thanks to the interactive worksheets in the resource files, the learning process is easy and enjoyable. By the end of this course, you can expect to create 3D models independently and whet your appetite to learn more about 3D modelling and Blender. So wait no more and start this journey to create 3D modelling.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
