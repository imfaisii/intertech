Microservices are replacing the traditional approach of designing, developing and maintaining a software code as one giant monolithic application. As applications are now moving to the cloud, a new approach is needed. Microservices are the building blocks for creating the next generation of cloud-native applications.","courseOutcomes":["Outline the challenges of the old-sc...","List the main building blocks of a s...","Describe the concept of microservice...","Define ‘cloud-native applications’...","Outline the challenges of the old-school software development style","List the main building blocks of a single microservice","Describe the concept of microservices architecture","Define ‘cloud-native applications’","Analyse the key advantages of microservices","Estimate the implementation challenges of microservices","Discuss the Netflix microservices industry case study","Outline the challenges of the old-sc...","List the main building blocks of a s...","Describe the concept of microservice...","Define ‘cloud-native applications’...","Outline the challenges of the old-school software development style","List the main building blocks of a single microservice","Describe the concept of microservices architecture","Define ‘cloud-native applications’","Analyse the key advantages of microservices","Estimate the implementation challenges of microservices","Discuss the Netflix microservices industry case study"],"courseDescription":"<p>Data is everywhere. It is the fuel to power up remarkable technologies and endless types of applications around us. If the data is the fuel, then the software code is the engine using this fuel. You can’t run the engine without high-quality fuel so software should be able to interface with many types of data sources, store and handle massive data volumes, provide a great user interface to end-users and automatically analyse and find valuable patterns inside the collected data. That’s the fundamental idea of utilising big data for various uses.</p><p>Until recently, many enterprise-level applications were designed, developed and maintained as one giant monolithic application. A monolithic application has a once or twice a year software release cycle. Every minor update requires building, testing and deploying all application modules as one package. This traditional legacy development approach is not good enough for the required agility of a fast-changing business landscape. The market demand is shifting to shorter release cycles. According to the up-to-data business requirements, software updates should be released and deployed in weeks, days and even hours.</p><p>As you can guess, the solution is about moving to a new software development style called ‘microservices architecture’. Microservices are changing the fundamental approach for developing applications and creating cloud-native applications. This training is designed to provide you with a solid theoretical understanding of the microservices concept, core building blocks, architecture, key advantages and challenges. Are you ready to join the Microservices Revolution?</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4393\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
