Or are you in need of an efficient coding language that is free of cost? This free online course will fulfil all your needs for a programming language that is not only cost-efficient but also easy to understand and apply. We begin with an introduction to the R programming language and its roots, followed by a brief description of its creators, its ranking compared to other languages and its source. We explain why R programming benefits the data science industry and is an attractive buy for data scientists. Then we provide a step-by-step guide to installing and using RStudio, the main platform of R programming. Various download and install options are available to suit your needs.</p><p>Do you know that you can perform basic mathematical functions using R programming? Discover the basic operations you can carry out using R programming, from performing basic calculations on the console to assigning variables. We describe the data types in R, when to use them and the general standards used while coding in R. Moving on, we analyse how to create vectors, select their components and label each vector element. Learn when to perform calculations with vectors and how to compare two or more vectors. Some more functions, such as mean, median and standard deviation and so on, are discussed along with their modification within the console of RStudio.</p><p>Building on vectors, we steer you towards the data objects like matrices and arrays. We provide an introduction to matrices and arrays and how to create them in R. For example, adding rows and columns, performing mathematical calculations, selecting certain elements of matrices and finding metrics of a matrix are all demonstrated in detail within the course. A key aspect of R is comparing matrices with arrays and their main differences. R is comparable to other popular commercial statistical packages available in the market but is free of cost. This aspect makes R programming one of the most widely used programming languages worldwide. So why waste any more time? Join this R programming course and become an expert, either in a professional or academic capacity.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
