This course on monitoring and alerting on CloudWatch through Amazon Web Services (AWS) will guide you every step of the way. In a constantly changing world where the information demands of corporations are increasing day by day, the need for more extensive data silos and secure cloud computing platforms is required. We kick off the course by introducing you to cloud computing. Then we discuss the key benefits of shifting towards cloud computing in today’s world. Next, we will identify the key users of AWS, adding to the credibility of the platform. We will also analyze the terms ‘monitoring’ and ‘alerting’ in cloud computing to ensure you understand what these functions do.&nbsp;</p><p>Wondering what CloudWatch is and how it can make your life easier? The next section of the course dives into the fundamental features of AWS CloudWatch. We will demonstrate each function and area, from monitoring log files to creating alarms on metrics. With cloud computing and networking, getting notified quickly is of critical importance. AWS ‘simple notifications service’ (SNS) is the notification feature that you can set up based on every organization’s or individual’s needs. Again, we will illustrate how to set up the SNS function properly. Are you wondering when the value of a specific metric crosses a particular threshold? Setting up alarms is an integral part of web services. We discuss how to do this on CloudWatch and analyze the elastic cloud computes (EC2) in detail until you grasp its key features and functions.</p><p>Are you looking to enhance storage to your AWS plan? We will examine the ‘elastic block’ storage offered by AWS in depth to give you an idea of the various available storage plans. We will research each plan along with its type of storage. Improving transparent scalability through elastic load balance and different monitoring options through relational database service will be described and demos supplied to ensure your understanding is sound. We finally discuss the costing billing mechanism of AWS, the pay-as-you-go mechanism offered by Amazon and the ability to look at real-time costs incurred. If any organization wants to succeed in today’s world, managing its data and staying safe is critical. Amazon Web Services provides customers with various packages that can genuinely help them with their data storage and cloud computing needs. So do not waste any more time.
