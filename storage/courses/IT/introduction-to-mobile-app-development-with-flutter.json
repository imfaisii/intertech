Introduction to Mobile App Development Course with Flutter is a free online course that helps you discover how to use Flutter effectively. We will show you how to build a complete Contacts App from scratch and how to make the most of this high-performance, intuitive framework. You will not just study Flutter in theory, but we will build a complete realistic app throughout this course. Flutter is powered by Dart, a programming language from Google that has excellent support for asynchronous operations, which is very important for todayâ€™s IO and Data-intensive applications.&nbsp;</p><p>We will start by installing Flutter SDK on Windows and Mac OS. You will learn the basic requirements to install and run Flutter from your development environment, covering everything from operating system compatibility, disk space to tools. The successful installation of Flutter depends on these tools being available in your environment. Learn about Flutter Doctor as a tool that tells you what you have or what you have not set up correctly for the app to run and build projects. You will also learn how Flutter relies on the complete installation of Android Studio to supply its Android platform dependencies. We will show you how to write your Flutter apps in several editors. We will use an Android emulator during the development process. The Virtual Device Manager is an interface you can launch from Android Studio to help you create and manage Virtual Devices.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, we will demonstrate how to convert a Contacts Page to a Stateful Widget. A Stateless Widget is a widget that describes part of the user interface by building a constellation of other widgets. The building process continues recursively until the description of the user interface is fully concrete. In Populating the contacts to initState, the build function runs once the Widget is initialized. InitState runs once per the Widget lifetime whenever the Widget is created. It is similar to how List.Generate runs. It runs when the class is expanciated and initState runs when the class is initialized. You will also learn how Navigation works with Flutter. Router is responsible for Navigation. In Flutter data, Router is called Navigator. Navigator is an inherited Widget, very similar to how Scoped Model is an inherited Widget. Routes are straightforward because you can animate how the page arrives. Finally, we will discuss how to convert Contact objects to Map. SEMBAST is a non-SQL database. Most of the non SQL Databases uses JSON to store objects persistently on storage. JSON is a simple way to convert objects in memory to some text that you can store somewhere. By using Flutter, you will write code just once and export your apps to both the Apple AppStore and to Google Play. This course helps you build your knowledge and expertise of Flutter.
