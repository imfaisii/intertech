It starts by introducing you to the development tools and the environment. First, you will examine AWS CLI as a way to begin managing an AWS account. Explore Python, which will be our primary language for dealing with AWS, and PyCharm, a powerful JetBrains IDE for Python development. Boto3 is a superb AWS library that Amazon currently supports. AWS account is one of the most crucial components, allowing you to experiment with AWS resources and create them. We will log into AWS Management Console and explore its key features. After you register a development user for an account and obtain credentials, you will discover how to use these to set up an environment with CLI for interaction.</p><p>The following section explains how to install tools and set up an environment on Linux, Windows or MAC OS. You will learn how to install Terraform, IntelliJ Plugin, Python 3, Pip, AWS SDK (CLI) and Boto3 on all operating systems. We describe how to set up environment variables for Terraform deployments and configure IDE to use Terraform efficiently by installing a Terraform Plugin. In addition, we provide a clear, detailed overview of Terraform and Fargate to implement this infrastructure easily. We explain the most often used Terraform functions and commands, Terraform language syntax, dependencies and states. Once you have set up everything, you can create Terraform code to put your architecture into practice. First, set up your remote state and develop the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment. To meet high-availability requirements, we will distribute our private and public subnets across three separate availability zones within a region.</p><p>Next, we explore developing an AWS ECS platform. To prepare for application deployment, you must register a domain for the Spring Boot application and construct an ECS cluster, target group, Application load balancer, HTTPS listener and certificate and IAM roles for the ECS cluster. Look at the Spring Boot application we will deploy to AWS ECS Fargate. Discover how to create ECS Fargate task definition, IAM role and policy, ECS service, target group, listener rule and CloudWatch log group in preparation for the application deployment. Finally, you will create a shell script to implement and develop the entire pipeline and complete each stage one by one. These are to build the code, build and push the Docker image to AWS ECR and finally deploy the Spring Boot application to AWS ECS Fargate.
