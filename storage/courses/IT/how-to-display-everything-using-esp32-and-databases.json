Did you ever think it would be possible to send such measured parameters to a web server? These days, there is very little that is impossible. The Internet of Things (IoT) has made engineers think of how they can integrate measured parameters with the internet. With the IoT, devices can send or receive data from other devices via the internet. This course will quickly show you a glimpse of how machines can receive and send data to the internet. Before getting into the content properly, we will reveal the requirements needed for the course. We will introduce you to the course instructor and the educators responsible for designing this course. The program is a practical one and, you will have to get your software and hardware ready before we can start. First, you will be shown how to download and install the Arduino app from the Arduino official website.</p><p>Furthermore, you will learn how to install the ESP32 add-on on the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). You will discover the required driver to install for the ESP32 ports to show on the Arduino IDE. You will then test your first code on the ESP32 board. Since you will be sending data from the ESP32 board to a webpage, you will need a webpage. The course will show you how to set up a website with free hosting and domain name. In addition, you will discover how to create an SQL database on your website and the SQL query for extracting a table of data from the database. Then we will show you the PHP scripts for inserting data in the database and displaying the database content on a webpage. You will appreciate how data can be requested from an ESP32 board and sent to a web server. You will recognise how to upload HTTP request code on the ESP32 board and display the board's reading on a webpage. The course concludes by guiding you in using the General Purpose Input Output (GPIOs) effectively.</p><p>If you are interested in displaying your electronics projects' data on the web, this course is for you. It explains how a web server can be connected with the ESP32 board to display measured parameters. You will discover how you can display the data of sensors connected to an ESP32 board on a webpage. With the practical demonstrations in this course, you will realise that there are gateways to showcasing the measured parameters of your electronics projects at a low cost. This course isn't just for those interested in embedded systems but also for those looking to create unique projects involving monitoring and controlling devices via the internet. With an ESP32 board and a web server, you can execute a project and monitor the measured data from anywhere in the world. Enrol for this free online course today and begin your journey to implementing inspiring and unique electronics and IoT-related projects.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/3694\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
