They have greatly influenced our way of life, where we work, how we do business, how we provide services and how we communicate. One of the key needs of these applications is to share and integrate with a range of other applications and systems to perform their essential functions. This is where APIs (Application Programming Interface) and API testing come into play. APIs are vital tools by which two different programs can communicate. Without APIs, the digital interactions we enjoy every day with our computers, smartphones, TVs, and other devices would not be possible. APIs allow faster innovation and easy monetisation, increasing their importance in all organisations. This course starts at the beginner's level with a definition of API, client-server architecture, web services and other fundamentals that will help you understand the working and testing of API.</p><p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) allows you to store and transfer data objects of attribute-value pairs and arrays using human-readable text. You will learn to write requests in JSON and create a test for GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests in postman and curl with hands-on training sessions. A client, as we know, can mean someone we do business with. Did you know 'client' means something entirely different in computing? Discover what 'client' means and how it can perform various operations on a result residing in a server. Do you know that apart from reading data, we can manipulate them? You will learn how a client can make that happen and the importance of these manipulations. Upon that, you will discover the operations known as CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) a client can perform and apply to a result residing in a server.</p><p>One of the ways a developer can improve their experience is through API documentation. This course provides you with an overview of API documentation and how to write and set up test cases. This course's classroom approach, which includes questions and answers, will also help you understand the fundamentals of software testing. The design of this course, from the basic to the advanced, is ideal for IT professionals, architects, end-users, and beginners who do not have any prior knowledge of API testing. By the end of this course, you will have all the knowledge and expertise to perform RESTful API testing using postman and curl manually. Learning API skills will also help you advance your career as an API Test Engineer. With an increase in demand for talented software testers worldwide, this is the best time to take advantage and build the skills, knowledge and confidence to pursue a rewarding career in this field.
