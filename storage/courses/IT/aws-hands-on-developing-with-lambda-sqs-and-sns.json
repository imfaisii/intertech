The Lambda service enables you not to have to manage servers and pay only when running code. You will start by learning about the tools required for the development process, creating an AWS account, logging in, seeing the AWS Console and creating credentials. Discover how to install the tools mentioned previously based on your operating system.</p><p>The following section is about queue operations. First, grasp how to create, list, and delete queues and then list and update their properties. Explore the basics of sending an individual a batch of messages, receiving, processing, deleting and purging them. Next, become acquainted with topic operations and subscriptions. Start by creating, listing, updating and deleting topics. Then you will examine the creation of email, SMS and queue subscription and learn to do checks. For example, if numbers “opt-in” by replying to an invitation or&nbsp; “opt-out” by responding to messages with ‘STOP’.</p><p>The final section is all about the lambda service and lambda functions. The starting point is the study of creating lambda access and an execution role and attaching that policy to the involvement. You then develop a Python Lambda function and deploy it. Other kinds of lambda functions will follow, including Javascript (js) and Java lambda. The final section builds on your knowledge about function invocation, versions, aliases, listing, updating and deleting participation.
