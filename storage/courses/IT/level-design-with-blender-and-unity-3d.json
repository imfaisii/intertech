After you design a game, it takes a level designer to create an interactive gameplay environment. Level designers are in charge of creating well-designed levels that guide the player's movement, which typically occurs without the player's knowledge. This course teaches you how to design and build your own 3D game levels. We begin by introducing you to the fundamental concepts and procedures involved in creating a video game level and then examine what a ‘level’ is, who is responsible for constructing it and the various roles involved in level design for video games. Using Photoshop, you will learn to develop an objective and plan and draw out your level.&nbsp;</p><p>Creating a level requires more than just developing a design and constructing whatever environment you want. You need to break down your level into modular pieces to build them with purposes. In this course, we'll create a level design project to help you understand modular design techniques and how to develop modular environment pieces. You will explore how to navigate the Blender software and manipulate objects within it. We'll begin the level design by creating ceiling and floor pieces and follow this up with the wall and catwalk pieces. Next, we'll introduce you to a core concept of level design known as a 'focal point' and how to create this for the level. After that, we demonstrate how to make practical props to help improve the game’s look and guide your players.</p><p>Adding textures to your pieces and assets gives them a more appealing look. We will illustrate how to do this via UV unwrap. UV unwrapping aids in the creation of a 2D texture that covers a 3D object. First, you'll investigate how to export Blender's UVs to Photoshop and create textures using these UVs. Then, you'll study how to take these textures to Blender and test them out to see what they look like on the model. Finally, we'll use the Unity game engine to build the level. This video-based course breaks down the level design process so you can clearly understand how level design concepts work. This course requires learners to install the Blender and Unity 3D software on their PCs. It is ideal for beginners and anyone serious about pursuing a career as a level designer in the video game industry.
