We examine each unit, from the power supply to the motherboard, processor, storage and CPU coolers, to show you how they all fit together. Once your computer has been put together, you need to give it a ‘test boot up’ in a process known as ‘troubleshooting’. We show you how to troubleshoot your new computer to ensure that everything is connected correctly.</p><p>Finally, we outline the features of the BIOS diagnostic tool. The course explains the hardware-monitoring capabilities of the BIOS and identifies the three vital areas to examine while using this tool. We then show you how to install a basic operating system and software applications on your newly assembled computer. We then cover some other important topics like networking, building a gaming computer and how to maintain your PC.
