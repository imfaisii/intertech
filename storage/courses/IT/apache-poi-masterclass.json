The process of learning this powerful POI starts with its installation on your system. We demonstrate how to download Apache POI directly or use it as a Maven dependency inside your Maven project. Apache POI is compatible with files having xls and xlsx file extensions and can perform several tasks involving data with the help of simple Java programs. We cover some commonly used cases of Apache POI and elaborate on a step-by-step process to create Excel files and add data to the cells using the POI library by writing a program in Eclipse. By formatting cells in Excel, we can increase data readability and emphasise certain elements in a sheet. We teach you how to apply various styling options to cells in an Excel file, including text alignment, setting borders, background colour, merging cells and more.</p><p>Like any coding task, learners can make many mistakes while writing their programs using Apache POI. Become an expert in quickly identifying and eliminating coding errors, fixing their logic mistakes and applying re-usable coding methods to save time and effort. Excel provides users with several formulas to perform mathematical calculations on a data set. Explore the simple logic required to use a formula on a data set in an Excel sheet to reach your desired result swiftly and efficiently. Analyse the sequence of steps necessary to add hyperlinks to a cell in Excel to access a URL, document or email. Users can apply logic in Eclipse to read any type of data in an Excel sheet and export it to a specified location. We will illustrate how to retrieve data from an Excel file and export it to any program or a database. You will become an expert in updating an Excel file using Eclipse.</p><p>We have designed this course for those who want hands-on experience in Apache POI for data manipulation and automated report generation based on MS Excel. Since Apache POI utilises several Java libraries, we require a basic knowledge of Java. This course is not simply a boring data dump of complex theories and programming techniques of Apache POI. Instead, it provides detailed information to write your program in Eclipse and resolve any related issues during the execution of your code in an interactive way. For a complete understanding and better engagement, we provide detailed answers to any questions you may have during the course. Apache POI is suitable for large files and consumes less memory making it an obvious choice for many leading IT and software companies around the globe. In turn, this generates several employment opportunities for people with expertise and knowledge in Apache POI. Why hesitate?
