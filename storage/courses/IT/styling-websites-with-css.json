The course will take you through the basics of CSS and how to set it up before explaining the meanings and functions of selectors, properties, values and units, how to do comments and implement colours to elements in CSS. We also explore the functions of margins and padding, differences between classes and IDs and the roles of grouping and nesting in styling websites. Manipulating text properties and borders is the next bit of content that we will discuss. Then we will explore some other themes, including the various types of pseudo-classes, shorthand properties, and how to implement background images to the scene.</p><p>Our focus will then shift to pseudo-elements and the manipulation thereof, and one of the most critical sections where we will explore layouts. Getting the website layout right is a vital part of the user experience. Some of the layout types you will become familiar with are the static layout, relative layout, and absolute layout, to mention a few. Styling individual elements add a terrific aesthetic to websites. This CSS tutorial will show you how to float and clear properties and create rounded corners for elements in CSS. We will also cover creating shadows, advanced selectors and -colours, how to use the attribute selector, transitions and transformations, and how to apply different CSS rules to different devices using media queries.</p><p>Styling a website is very important because it provides a good user experience, making the website and pages aesthetically pleasing to users. This, in turn, will determine how often people visit your website and how long they stay on your website. A well-styled website can create a good impression on prospective customers and help website visitors access and navigate your website easily. Suppose you are a website development professional or otherwise involved in programming. In that case, knowing how to use CSS to style websites will give your career a significant boost, and it might just lead to new job opportunities.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
