The audio-only app hosts live discussions, with opportunities to participate through speaking and listening. The app was first introduced to iOS by Paul Davison and Rohan Seth of Alpha Exploration Co. in March 2020, with a beta launch for Android in May 2021. They stated it on an invite-only basis to ensure their team can manage the growth of its user base. The app is refined continuously to be capable of supporting a larger audience. Clubhouse extended its accessibility to the public by launching the full Android version in May 2021. Conversations are prohibited by Clubhouse's guidelines from being recorded, transcribed, reproduced, or shared without explicit permission. This has been a source of controversy because bullying, harassment, and racism have occurred on the app.</p><p>Vogue described the app's experience as \"a dizzying bringing together of live podcast-style conversations, panel discussions, networking opportunities, with some savvy people are already swapping 'influencer' for 'moderator'.\" The magazine was impressed with its advantageous multiple-room use, with locked and private options available so you can talk to pals too. The social-media app mimics real-life interactions. The main feature of Clubhouse is virtual \"rooms\" in which users can communicate via audio. Rooms are categorized based on differing levels of privacy. This course takes you through creating a room, the different types of rooms, and how to invite someone as a speaker. Many conversations on Clubhouse occur spontaneously, but users also can plan conversations by creating events. Users can also add co-hosts to help moderate the event. You will learn how to create and modify these events.</p><p>When used correctly, Clubhouse can help you develop new ideas and get information from thought leaders you don't have access to. With Clubhouse, it is easier to interact with fascinating people worldwide and connect with them. You can also use Clubhouse to network or establish yourself as a thought-leader or influencer. Clubhouse hits a riveting intersection of benefits in social media, especially if you want to build your profile. It allows you to build your organic reach. You may have a large following on other platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, but the engagement and ability reach is very much throttled. Clubhouse is at a stage where you can reach far and wide, especially without advertising. This course outlines how one can effectively take advantage of Clubhouse to influence people and also for networking. By the end of this course, you will be able to identify the basics of Clubhouse and insights from some experts in the social media world.
