This course helps you understand and apply this advanced machine learning technique in your day-to-day data analysis activities using the Python programming language. The video-based lessons will make the complex machine learning algorithms easy for you to understand. For those who are new to Python, a crash course is included to show you how to install Python and Anaconda software and introduces you to Python commands and libraries. All the steps involved in solving a business problem through a decision tree are covered in this course. Although the focus is on teaching you how to run the analysis, this course also teaches you how to select the correct data, how to preprocess the data, and after running the analysis, judge the quality of your model.</p><p>You will be using the Jupyter Notebook application provided by Anaconda to follow the videosâ€™ steps. Once you have downloaded and set up Anaconda and Python, you will learn machine learning basics. The course explains what machine learning is, how it is related to SVM, and what its applicability is in different business scenarios. You will be introduced to the concept of hyperplanes and the maximum margin classifier. You will see that this classifier has limitations, which will lead you through the concepts of the support vector classifier to the kernel-based support vector machines. Next, you will follow the steps of importing data into the Jupyter environment, tidying up and preprocessing the data, splitting it up for training and testing purposes and finally building the SVM models. You will begin by building a regression model and then move on to building classification models. You will learn how to tune the hyperparameters for potentially better and more accurate results. You will also learn to build advanced SVM models with polynomial and radial kernels and their hyperparameter tuning.</p><p>Does the idea of learning advanced SVM techniques starting from scratch intrigue you? Would you like the confidence to get ahead in your field of expertise? Then this course is for you! It guides you through everything you need to know to create an SVM model in Python. There are no prerequisites to enrol for this course, although an understanding of statistical methods may be helpful. After completing this course, you will be able to apply machine learning and SVM techniques to real-life business problems. This course will help you grow professionally and enhance your career prospects in data science. So, why wait any longer? Dive into the course and be proficient in the classification skill everyone is raving about.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/3309\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
