RubyGems are modules that provide a range of options and functionalities during the development of an application (app). Often, developers refer to using Gems as a ‘magical’ way of writing codes. Essentially, you will learn how Gems are used as Ruby code files to perform many types of tasks for users. This course explains how Gems are used to create an application without having to write every feature in the application from scratch. Do you know that time and effort are two factors that developers consider when working on a software project? Using Gems can save you a lot of both, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time. By taking this course, you will learn more about the numerous Gems available for you. You will study Gems such as RSpec, which provides a fully automated test framework for applications. You will be introduced to ‘devise gem’, which allows you to create a full authentication feature. You will also get to work with ‘pundit gem’, which gives developers the ability to build a complete permission structure to ensure users follow the correct authorization rules.</p><p>The course also discusses how to create and use view partials in a Ruby on Rails application. You will be taken through some advanced techniques used for working with Embedded Ruby (ERB). Do you know that images are an integral part of every Rails application? In this course, you will be shown how to add images to a Rails app, including the ability to customize their sizes. Have you ever integrated CSS (cascading style sheets) during the development of an application? To integrate CSS in a Rails application, you need to learn how to use the CSS and SCSS files in the Rails asset pipeline. You will also see how to use custom fonts within the Rails asset pipeline and learn to integrate custom websafe fonts into a Ruby on Rails application. An exciting concept covered in this course is ActionCable, which happens to be one of the most popular features in Rails 5. You will be taken through how to integrate ActionCable and Rails Channels to incorporate live data.</p><p>Developers are usually rated on their adherence to best practices during the development of an application. This course concludes by focusing on Rails best practices and how they can be incorporated into an app, including protecting against bugs, improving data integrity, and testing for security issues. It ​​examines the final items that need to be completed before deploying a Ruby on Rails application. Do you know that It is essential to understand how to securely show and hide posts from users in a Rails application? The course walks you through custom scopes to hide draft blog posts from non-admin users. The material examines how you can leverage the status enum to call draft and published blog posts quickly. You will study the multiple ways to implement a widget that renders on the layout of a Ruby on Rails application. Having radio buttons is an important skill to have when it comes to building out forms in Rails. This course teaches you how to update the Blog status enum value with a radio button. Finally, you will be taken through the steps for signing up for a Heroku account. You will also learn how to run the commands needed to create the application that will host our application.
