Kubernetes is no doubt the most popular and well-versed container orchestration tool. Kubernetes automates many time-consuming processes in deploying, managing and scaling containerized applications. We have created this course for anyone interested in launching a professional DevOps career. We begin with an introduction to Kubernetes, where you will learn the fundamentals, history and business values of the platform.</p><p>Containers help package applications in a standardized manner by separating the operating system from the app code and by also isolating individual processes. We will teach you about microservices, which aid in creating scalable, testable software that you can deliver weekly rather than yearly. It is easy to deploy, re-usable, able to defect isolation and has a lower risk. We will teach you about Kubernetes terms such as ‘pods’, ‘clusters’ and ‘nodes’ and how to deploy them. Finally, we will demonstrate how to install kubectl, a command line interface that can run commands against the Kubernetes cluster, deploy minikube and services and manage applications.</p><p>If your job requires you to create containerized applications, manage and deploy them, or maintain a containerized environment, you must learn Kubernetes. If you are a practitioner, you will almost certainly come across K8s in some form or another. Learning how to deploy Kubernetes effectively is the best way to jumpstart your DevOps career. This course gives you an essential understanding of the Kubernetes or K8s architecture and provides hands-on practical labs to reinforce your core concepts.
