We have designed this course to teach you how to use Kubernetes with Docker to avoid downtime. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating containerised applications' deployment, scaling and management. It supports multi-cloud, on-premise VMs and bare metal, and it automatically allocates resources such as memory and CPU as needed. This course introduces microservices, a software architecture in which apps are broken down into small autonomous services. You'll learn about the Google Cloud Platform and Google Cloud Shell. Learn how to set up VirtualBox and Docker and how to use a Docker build image.</p><p>We'll then dive into Kubernetes and show you how to manage containerised applications in a clustered environment. You'll also learn about Kubernetes terms like ‘pod’, which is Kubernetes’ basic unit and represents one or more containers that should be controlled as a single application. Using the replication controller, you'll also learn how to define horizontally scaled pods. Next, you'll learn to create clusters and link to code repositories using the Docker hub cloud-based registry service. Finally, we'll show you how to ‘clean’ the guest book and deploy patterns.</p><p>This course is for app developers and anyone interested in creating scalable applications and deploying them quickly using Kubernetes and Docker. We created this course to teach you how to avoid app downtime by creating frameworks for reliably executing systems using Kubernetes and Docker. Kubernetes is in high demand so it's a great idea for app developers to learn more about it. Enrol now and create and manage scalable apps with no downtime.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4714\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
