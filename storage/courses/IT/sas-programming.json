Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) is used for advanced analytics like business intelligence, crime investigation, and predictive analysis. This data science course will teach you the various functions and analyses available using SAS programming including importing data and running statistical analyses using easy-to-understand methods.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Before diving into learning SAS and how to use it, you need to download and install World Programming System (WPS). The first topic in this programming course guides you through the installation process and teaches you some of the SAS elements that the software supports. You will be shown how to import data using SAS which is available in different formats and file types and the set of rules needed to write code and organize it into two types of blocks - the data step and the procedure or proc step, and the difference between the two. Data options, control, and separation along with how to read and display the date and time in SAS are then discussed.</p><p>A variable is any entity that can take on different values and the course content explains how to create new variables on an existing file, the different kinds of expressions that you would have to deal with in the process, and how to logically process your dataset to produce the desired outcome using a conditional clause. Other data operations are worked through, such as filtering and sorting, input for input statements, declaration of variables and how you can define your own formats in SAS. You will be taught what functions are and how they work in order to perform a number of tasks. The next section covers using your data to create customizable graphs and charts and how to run statistical analyses on the available data and predict trends. Have you ever faced problems while performing different data analyses? This data science certification will elaborate on various analytical methods such as the chi-square test, simple linear regression and multiple linear regression.</p><p>The field of data science is growing exponentially with an ever-increasing amount of data that is creating more and more jobs. SAS is one of the most widely used software platforms in the field of data science and can add valuable technical knowledge to your skillset. This data analytics certification is intended both for self-taught computer language enthusiasts as well as IT students and will take you on a journey from setting up the application to fully executing your codes and run analyses, all in a fun way. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to stand among the experts in SAS and hone your programming skills in a new and exciting way.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
