It supports various business and financial transactions and maintains the record of transactions among computers. Are you new to blockchain technology? This course covers blockchain fundamentals to help you grasp the concept and mechanism behind NEM blockchain technology. You'll learn its concepts, smart assets, features and functions in the NEM blockchain platform. Then explore the components of the NEM smart assets, network and tokens and the properties of mosaic and namespaces. We'll help you understand the mining (harvesting) protocol in the NEM blockchain platform, mining techniques and the conditions under which they must operate.</p><p>The NEM blockchain technology within its decentralised network keeps track of transaction records. We demonstrate how this network monitors and maintains transactional data among several computers and how these are grouped in the NEM network. You'll explore how the NEM platform ensures security, truthfulness, transparency, validity and relevance in its operation. Additionally, we break down every complex technical jargon, such as ‘crypto economics’ and ‘smart contracts’, into simple, understandable terms to facilitate your familiarity with NEM. Since it maintains transaction data within its network, it is essential to know how data or file storage and distribution solutions function. We examine and compare the NEM blockchain technologies for distributed file storage and how they are designed for the job.</p><p>The NEM blockchain technology ensures additional security through the concept known as the 'proof element', which keeps the NEM blockchain complete, consistent and unalterable. We discuss the concept of 'proof of work' (where the work involves solving a cryptographic puzzle) and 'delegated proof of stake'. We demonstrate how to use the NEM platform to send and receive coins. You'll learn how to use a multi-signatory account and Apostille service, configure a Node.js environment and install a software development kit such as the JavaScript and Typescript SDK. This course is not intended for untechnical students but does not require crypto/smart contract/blockchain experience. NEM blockchain is vital because it increases trust, transparency, security and traceability of data distributed across business networks by eradicating the need for a trusted third party. Hence, enrol and start this course today if you want to integrate your business with the NEM blockchain technology.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4986\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
