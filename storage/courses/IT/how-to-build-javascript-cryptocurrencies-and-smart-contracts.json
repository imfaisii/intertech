Blockchains are decentralized and distributed networks that eliminate the need for a third-party such as banks or central banks to conduct transactions. We will show you how to create a high-level implementation of blockchain concepts with the help of an integrated development environment (IDE) and JavaScript libraries. To enable optimal user interface (UI) for our crypto project, we need to get the Angular project set up with a styling library so the UI we create is visually and functionally acceptable. You'll learn about the libraries, classes, commands and syntax for creating a crypto project by following simple programming logic. Miners must ensure that new transactions are true, relevant and valid before submitting them to the blockchain. Explore the concept of 'proof of work' as a tool to validate blockchains and how it keeps irrelevant transactions and spam from overloading the blockchain data.</p><p>A blockchain transaction is made after certain conditions are met and both the sender and receiver agree on the transaction details. You'll explore the complete mechanism of generating blockchain transactions and the necessary programming instructions to complete the task. The ‘wallet’ class checks the coin balance and exchanges coins with other users on the blockchain network. Research cryptocurrency protocols to digitally sign transactions to make them secure, unalterable and provable. Smart contracts are simple logics executed by some 'triggers' or when certain conditions are satisfied in a blockchain network. You will study the data elements required to create a smart contract and how to create a processing language in a blockchain class that can handle your smart contracts effectively.</p><p>We designed this course for people dealing with or interested in cryptocurrencies. This course is also helpful for people who studied blockchain networks and now want to refresh their knowledge and expertise in the field. Knowledge and experience in JavaScript and cryptocurrencies are not mandatory. However, being equipped with technical know-how in JavaScript and exposure to the crypto market will give you an advantage. We have divided this course into two sections beginning with JavaScript cryptocurrencies and then moving on to smart contracts. Brett Hooper, your instructor, will teach you how to write simple programs to create cryptocurrency without a JavaScript command. Cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity due to their ease of use and decentralized nature. This, in turn, opens up a vast array of career opportunities for professionals in the field of cryptocurrency to either work on their own or find jobs in an organization.
