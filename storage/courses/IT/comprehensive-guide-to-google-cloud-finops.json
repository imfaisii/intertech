The public cloud can present significant cost management difficulties for an enterprise. FinOps (Financial Operations) can help solve cloud cost management issues in today's multi-cloud systems. It is a cloud financial management practice that enables businesses to get the most out of their cloud investments. FinOps does this by helping business teams to collaborate on data-driven spending decisions. In this course, we'll explain the basics of FinOps and provide valuable information on how FinOps operations are managed. We begin by explaining what FinOps is and why it is important. On top of that, we'll break down the concepts of FinOps into easily understandable bits and explain in detail the three phases of the FinOps lifecycle.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, we discuss the FinOps triangle and highlight some of the best practices involving Google Cloud FinOps. We will teach you how to manage FinOps with Google Cloud. You'll discover the frequently used FinOps tools and services that Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers, including BigQuery, cloud hierarchies, reports, and more. You'll learn about Google Cloud Epic, how to manage costs on Google Cloud, including how to manage your resources using the Google resource manager. Upon that, we'll help you understand the hierarchy and segmentation of GCP resources. We provide you with demos and whiteboard analysis on how to use the FinOps tools effectively. You will study the difference between tags and labels and how to estimate the costs of cloud resources to keep track of your cloud spending effectively. In addition, we'll explore some of the options for managing costs on GCP.&nbsp;</p><p>While there are no specific rules on GCP, it's important to follow best practices from experts to reduce costs and become more efficient. You'll explore the best technique to follow to ensure proper cloud management. We also discuss computer billing and discount models. You'll learn how to identify cost optimization opportunities with cloud storage and the dynamics to cost controls with DevOps.
