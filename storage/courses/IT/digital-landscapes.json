This graphic design course has the necessary information to unlock your potential in computer graphics and is excellent for beginner and intermediate 3D artists who are familiar with the 3ds Max program interface and want to take their career to the next level. This graphic design certificate discusses how to create beautiful and photorealistic worlds in 3ds Max and Corona renderer and some of the tools and techniques focused on in this section include the Corona proxy technique to convert object models to proxy objects, how to combine the Corona scatter technique with the Corona proxy technique to distribute proxy objects on a plane along with the other lighting techniques and atmospheric effects to create a fantasy landscape.</p><p>Modelling is an important aspect of computer graphics that enables a 3D artist to design and visualize space environments. A practical demonstration for modelling covers how to create an ancient temple and its elements using the reference images technique and the role of 3ds Max software&nbsp; tools such as the spline tool and the polygon tool to model elements. Specific other elements you will learn about to enhance your ancient temple are the mirror tool and fillet tool to mirror objects and make outlines of an image rounder and the texturing technique to add texture to models. Using shadows is also very important in designing photorealistic graphics and this is done by the ambient occlusion rendering technique which also improves aerial perspective. The rock generator plugin is the next piece of content discussed after which you will learn how to do your post-production edits using Photoshop.</p><p>Knowing how to create, modify and apply computer graphics is a highly valuable skill in today's economy. This course will take you through the creation of large and beautiful landscapes and how to model architectural objects.
