You will learn about the optimization criteria for the scheduling algorithm, as well as scheduling algorithms like the first come first serve (FCFS) policy and the shortest-job-first (SJF) policy.</p><p>Then, this course will also introduce you to the performance of the round-robin algorithm in operating systems as well as the importance of priority scheduling in scheduling policy. Furthermore, this course will teach you about the role of the queue in the scheduling process. You will also learn how to measure CPU burst by using the exponential averaging method, as well as the concept of process synchronization.</p><p>Finally, this course will introduce you to the producer-consumer problems of process synchronization along with the various algorithm processes that are possible in synchronization. This course will then improve your knowledge of the classical problems that can be encountered in process synchronization. Begin this course and enhance your knowledge on the use of mutex lock, as well as the implementation of semaphores in process synchronization.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/2552\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
