Hyperledger includes various components that allow its architecture to flourish, such as Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Sawtooth and many more. This course focuses on the various technicalities of Hyperledger Fabric without going into deep coding. Hyperledger Fabrics is part of the Hyperledger framework of blockchain solutions and is one of the most exciting enterprise blockchains on the market. We begin by introducing you to the blockchain, its history and architecture. You'll gain an in-depth understanding of trust and trustless blockchains, including the differences between its permissioned and permissionless forms. Upon that, we'll discuss the concept of ‘blockchain consensus’ and provide you with many demos on hashing and how blockchain transactions are made. We highlight some frameworks of the Hyperledger project and their uses, as well as how the consortium works together.&nbsp;</p><p>How does Hyperledger Fabric compare with other blockchain platforms? What are the advantages of Hyperledger Fabric? First, you'll explore some benefits of Hyperledger Fabric over Ethereum, R3 Corda and Quorum blockchains. Next, you will learn about the unique features of Hyperledger Fabric and its terminologies. How does Hyperledger make transactions? How many transactions can Hyperledger handle? Discover how to complete transactions in Hyperledger and the order in which transaction proposals are made. We'll discuss the various types of nodes and consensus, including deploying chain codes on both IBM blockchain as a service and Amazon web services blockchain templates. After that, we'll highlight some of the use cases of Hyperledger Fabric and discuss the importance of the Hyperledger channels. We demonstrate how to deploy a client application and some requirements for deploying an app to the network.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, you'll study the Hyperledger Fabric composer, composer playground and its components. You'll learn how to use the composer playground, deploy some sample chaincodes in the IBM cloud and use the Swagger API to visualize and interact with the API's resources. We discuss the fabric Representational State Transfer (REST) services API with Hyperledger Fabric and the development lifecycle of a composer. Finally, you'll explore blockchain certifications and the existing job roles in blockchain technology. We'll provide you with additional resources to help bolster your understanding of the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. This course requires learners to have a basic knowledge of blockchain networking and has been designed specifically for cloud architects and systems integrators. Hyperledger Fabric is currently one of the most popular blockchain platforms used by many enterprise organizations as the foundation of their projects.
