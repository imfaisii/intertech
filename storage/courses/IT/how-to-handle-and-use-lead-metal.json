Although it is useful, it is a severe health and safety hazard. Indestructible and non-biodegradable, it is considered a 'silent killer' as the health effects of lead exposure are serious. Because lead is so potentially dangerous, the only way to tackle this menace is to be aware of the dangers of lead poisoning and take precautionary measures to reduce its effects. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has also specified the permissible limit of lead in food, water, air, soil and items we use in our everyday activities. According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) standard for the general industry, lead awareness training is mandatory for any worker exposed to harmful levels of lead on the job. This course explores making the workplace safe and preventing dangerous lead exposure from affecting employees' health. Study the best practices, techniques and industry measures to identify and prevent hazardous lead exposures and reduce lead-related occurrences.</p><p>The course will first introduce you to the risks associated with lead exposure, lead-related occurrences, the applicable laws and how you can avoid risks. Then, you will become aware of the related health and safety laws that comply with primary industry Environment Health and Safety (EHS) norms and regulations laid out by OSHA. The lessons are presented in a simple video-based format with interactive images and content. All the topics culminate in engaging formative questions followed by a final assessment to test your learning and preparedness at the end of the course.</p><p>Lead is a well-recognised toxicant acknowledged as a grave health hazard. This course is perfect for you if you are a construction worker, carpenter, builder, painter, decorator, plumber or anybody who encounters lead at work. It is best suited for employers or employees who wish to make themselves or their workplace safe. However, it also caters to the requirements of individuals, independent workers, contractors or anybody whose work conditions expose them to lead or lead-containing materials and who wants a deeper understanding of safe handling practices when using lead metal. So join the course now and become lead-wise.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4713\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
