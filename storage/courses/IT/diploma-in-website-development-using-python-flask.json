A website visitor primarily sees the front, comprising images and layouts. All the logic that makes things happen is on the back end. Those who build websites therefore have a responsibility to guarantee that they are competent in both elements of website construction. Back-end development, where you have HTML, CSS and JavaScript, might appear more daunting than the front-end. This is because many back-end languages make being a back-end developer a challenge. The term ‘web developer’ does not apply to anybody in the industry today. You are either a ‘back-end’, a ‘front-end’ or one of the few ‘full-stack’ web developers. But because there are numerous advancements to learn in both the back-end and front-end subject areas, full-stacks (or ‘web developers’) are highly uncommon in formal environments. If you've never programmed before, don't be concerned. This free online course will give you the basics you need to get started. You'll learn how to use Python, Flask and Cloud9 to create the career path toward becoming a professional back-end developer.</p><p>Step through the process of creating web apps, beginning with Python fundamentals. Here you will learn basic shell commands, variables, string functions and everything you need to know about conditional and control flows. You will also study the differences between Python classes and objects and the nuances between arguments and parameters. Then you will move towards the second part of the course, where you will start interacting with the Cloud9 programming environment. You will study how to debug errors, make routes and comprehend various methods and programming commands like the 'post' method and the 'URL for' command. Create the login page, templates and cookies and learn how to integrate encoded sessions with databases and create tables.</p><p>After this training, you will have acquired the knowledge necessary to construct and launch a Flask-Python online blog from the ground up, using a completely new virtual web design environment. This environment provides you with a web server that includes database capabilities. Did you know the Flask 'Hello, World!' code is only seven lines long? Not only will you comprehend each line, but we will go deeper by understanding the creative process of your first Flask blog throughout the third module. This training is a fantastic chance to get you started on back-end development if you are unfamiliar with the Python programming language. You'll build a small blogging system that shows how to establish one-to-many relationships using the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension. Later, you'll learn how to use it with the Flask-Migrate extension to do SQLAlchemy logical database design migrations through the Flask command-line interface. The instructional strategy invites novices and businesses just getting started to participate in learning Python. This simple programming language may assist you in automating tedious processes, making your life simpler and more productive. Come along with us on this journey and launch your first Flask application.
