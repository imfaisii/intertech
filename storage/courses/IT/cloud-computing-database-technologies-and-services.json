Over the last couple of years, the application requirements to store and handle data have changed substantially. There are more data types to manage, much higher data volumes to operate and a need to keep the data longer. This need has led to the rise of cloud-based database services.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>In the new digital age, data is the primary ‘energy source’ that drives the ongoing operations of organizations and business companies worldwide. This ‘energy source’ requires massive storage containers that are flexible, fast, reliable, easy to manage and cost-effective. As a result, today’s applications are handling more data types with much higher data volumes.</p><p>The data storage container for the upper layer applications is all about databases. As we will learn during the training, selecting the right database technology for a specific use case can dramatically affect the performance of any application. Due to the substantial change in the application requirements to store and handle data, cloud-based database services are on the rise as there is an increase in the types and volume of data that needs to be managed. Present-day applications use a variety of database technologies optimized for different use cases.</p><p>This course is about database technologies and, more specifically, how such technologies are offered as cloud database services (DBaaS) by leading public cloud providers: Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We will learn the technical concept of each database technology, their market use cases and their key advantages and disadvantages while following the market's evolution path to the development of cloud-based database services.
