The concept of virtual hosts allows more than one website on one system or web server and the servers are differentiated by their hostname. This DigitalOcean course will take you through step-by-step procedures of configuring a droplet with LAMP stack on Ubuntu 18.04 and what you will need for this course is the PuTTY application, a registered domain name, access to a domain registrar, and a DigitalOcean account. Learning how to host multiple domains on one virtual server can be for various personal or career reasons and irrespective of the reason, this virtualization guide will teach you how to navigate the DigitalOcean admin panel to achieve your desired results and configuration. The course explores an exciting new feature offered by DigitalOcean, called \"Floating IP's\" which allows you to transfer IP's easily between multiple droplets including the benefits of working with floating IPs and compares the floating IP with Amazon web service IP.</p><p>The next part of this virtual machine course, teaches you the technicalities of setting up and installing Apache, MySQL, PHP, PhpMyAdmin, and the related authentication methods. Various privileges granted to a user affects the MySQL database in different ways and this course covers all of the possible permutations.
