You will also learn how to create an element maker function to generate elements within the JavaScript code, add and append new elements to the parent, add a class, element tag, and HTML content within the element. Then you will proceed to update styling with CSS to set dynamically created elements on the web page.</p><p>Furthermore, you learn how to add animation frames to create a smooth movement of elements using the window request animation frame method. The material teaches you how to create a movement for the slot wheels with JavaScript by updating the position of the element on the page and restacking the order within a parent element, getting element property values to use within the code to update position, and offsetting top with JS. Study how to set conditions and calculations to manipulate element style positions to create an animation of elements with JavaScript code. The course also teaches you how to create game movement and how to debug your application in order to create and optimize gameplay.</p><p>Finally, you learn how to create a final tally object that can be used to calculate the final results for the player, and track matches and number of occurrences to be able to apply calculations on a win. Then you see how to improve visuals, test the gameplay to ensure proper functionality, update the global game object values to test dynamic content and use colours to add more appeal to gameplay.
