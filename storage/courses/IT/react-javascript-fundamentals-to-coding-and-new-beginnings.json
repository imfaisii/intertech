It requires less coding experience to build user interfaces and web applications than plain JavaScript (JS), but web development professionals still need a firm grasp of computer languages. The experts at Digital Partner have designed this course to equip you with the knowledge and skills you need to work with React to create interactive user interfaces for webpages and online applications.</p><p>This course includes two modules. The first introduces you to React JS and outlines its keys, components and props. We explain how to create your first React environment and modify the contents of File App.js. We also show you how to remove and render the code and work with JSX expressions, large HTML blocks, one top-level element in JavaScript XML (JSX) and ‘fragments’ used to wrap lines.</p><p>Our second module covers more complex React concepts. We demonstrate how to structure a folder in React and use CSS Styling to customise the appearance of online content. The course also covers code writing and the use of ‘Files’ to make components. We discuss the use of ‘if’ statements, React events and the role of props as parameters. We explain how to use React conditional statements, operators, lists, keys and forms. The course provides written JS codes and shows you how to visualise their results before incorporating them into your work. Sign up for this web development course to train as a React operator and learn how to use this popular, open-source JS library to create online user interfaces.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
