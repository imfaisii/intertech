To start, we will describe the fundamental ideas behind blockchain technology before separating a blockchain from a distributed ledger, terms that are sometimes used interchangeably but are actually quite distinct. The numerous types of blockchain and blockchain use cases will be covered, along with how to use a blockchain explorer to track blockchain activity.</p><p>With a primary focus on decentralized networks, Web3 offers consumers more control and security. Blockchains, like Ethereum, provide a reliable platform to get encrypted data. These are some of the advantages of Web3, which we will discuss in this course. In addition, we will examine the risks, difficulties and role of Ethereum in Web3's development. How are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) utilized in Web3? Learn more about the function of non-fungible tokens in Web3. Tokens and cryptocurrencies are \"digital assets\" upon which blockchain technology is built. We will demystify how cryptocurrencies are used in Web3.</p><p>Metaverse has garnered much attention after Facebook announced expanding its brand to include its own metaverse experience. Learn about the metaverse's goals and its seven layers. Other topics we will cover are three-dimensional (3D), decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), and decentralized finance (DeFi). When it comes to Web2 and Web3, which one is better? The answer primarily depends on your internet usage habits and the degree of digital savvy you are willing to reach as the years pass. However, the options provided by Web3 are appealing to a younger generation that is more technologically smart and digitally adept. One very compelling reason to embrace the possibility of the digital future is the chance to own and govern your data on a decentralized and unregulated blockchain.
