In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Java as well as the different editions such as standard, enterprise and micro. We will show you the OOPs principle to help enhance your design concepts. By following the coding standards in this course, you will become more adept in working with Java.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Java is one of the most popular general-purpose, multiplatform programming languages used by millions of developers worldwide. Programs written in Java can run on any operating system such as Windows, Linux and Mac. In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Java and apply them to real-life situations before gradually mastering these fundamentals as you explore more advanced concepts. First, we introduce you to its syntax, and class naming conventions, methods, constants, and variables. After that, we analyze its structure, such as classes, objects and data types. Then, we examine what operators are and use them in your codes.</p><p>Java programs are organized in classes, and the scope of a variable is the part of the program where the variable is accessible. We teach you how to categorize a variable by its scope and the different condition statements you can use to iterate through loops in Java. Gain a thorough understanding of array data structures, array initialization and data retrieval from arrays. On top of that, we show you how to initialize a multidimensional array using loops and also retrieve its data. We highlight how loops can be controlled during execution using break and continue statements. How do you manage workspace efficiently in your Java project? This is the role packages play. ‘Packages’ are the folders in which we place related Java files. You will become familiar with packages, how nested packages work, and how to access the class of a package and import it to another one. We show you how to create, distribute and consume them.&nbsp;</p><p>Object-oriented programming (OOPs) principles are fundamental because they form the foundation of designing any useful application in Java. We help you understand the OOPs principle by guiding you on encapsulating your code and implementing polymorphism. In addition, we demonstrate the critical concepts of Java such as constructors, keywords and exceptions. Java is a top programming language as we can use it to design and customize applications that are fast and serve a plethora of purposes. It is relatively easy to learn, beginner-friendly and easily readable as it has a syntax similar to the English language. It has rich community support and a variety of open-source library support. This course is essential for beginners and developers of all skill levels who want to broaden their programming knowledge. Due to the high demand for Java, specialist developers are sought after, and they hold some of the most high-paying jobs in the programming industry.
