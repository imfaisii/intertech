Are you curious to understand what ‘non-fungible tokens’ (NFTs) are and how you can take advantage of this new and thriving ecosystem as a layman? If you want to learn about or become involved with cryptocurrencies, the metaverse and selling and buying NFTs, then this course is for you. It is brought to you by Manas Roy, a storytelling expert, digital marketer and author. According to his students, his instruction style is 'edutaining' and his courses are full of valuable insights as he makes things uncomplicated. In this course, you will learn simple and understandable terms about the digital universe and how you can profit from it.</p><p>We begin by introducing cryptocurrencies, specifically Ethereum. We will study how they evolved to be more versatile than Bitcoin as they enable minting of NFTs. NFTs are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated. You'll learn some important recommendations for minting NFTs securely. You will also learn how to read whitepapers for cryptocurrencies and how to do research from recommended news sources to make well-informed decisions. We investigate how to mint NFTs on Polygon, Solana and other blockchains. You will understand the advantages of the different blockchains to confidently sell your NFTs on whichever platform you choose.</p><p>Bitcoin is different and stands apart from the other cryptocurrencies. It is a leader in its own right. Its rise or fall on the market determines the rise or fall of most other coins on the market. This phenomenon is called the 'Bitcoin effect' and will be explained more extensively in the latter section of the course. We will compare the digital financial system and the traditional centralised finance system. It is known as the ‘decentralised finance system’ (DeFi). DeFi enables commerce in the digital sphere without traditional middlemen such as governmental institutions. Finally, we will explore the metaverse, a virtual universe with markets and interactions financed with digital money. This course is for beginners in the crypto space, beginner NFT artists, designers and scholars. It is also for those who want to enhance their knowledge of the Web 3.0 space.
