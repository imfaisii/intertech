Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory and assigning blocks to various running programs to optimize overall system performance. You will learn about virtual memory and its structure, virtual address mapping, segmentation, booting a computer system, and more.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>While the CPU is probably arguably the most important hardware resource, a close second is computer memory. This course will first introduce you to the Single Contiguous Model and the Partition Model for memory management. You will then learn how MMU mapping works and discuss the Page Table Pointer Register (PTPR), the virtual address, and the physical address. You will also look into virtual memory and learn how it works in a computer system.</p><p>Virtual memory does not split programs into logical modules. Instead, it splits programs into fixed-size blocks. Segmentation splits the program into segments that are more logical. This course will teach you about segmentation memory management and how it can be more logical than virtual memory. You will study xv6 operating systems memory management, the computer booting process, and the hardware initialization process performed by the ROM Basic Input Output System (ROM BIOS).</p><p>By the end of this Operating Systems - Introduction to Memory Management course you will have gained a strong understanding of how memory management works in a computer operating system. Once you have gained mastery of segmentation, mapping, booting, and optimizing the overall system performance of a computer operating system, this will open up some really advanced computer programming skills and lessons.
