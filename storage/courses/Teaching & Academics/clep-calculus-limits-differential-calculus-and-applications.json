You will be introduced to the concepts of limits, as well as how to find them from tables or graphs. You will understand how to calculate limits using different theorems. Important concepts to understand are the limits of trigonometric and rational functions. The Sandwich theorem is a useful tool in calculating some types of limits and you will see how to use it. You will also learn about the relationship between limits and asymptotes. Did you know that there are two types of asymptotes? The average and instantaneous rates of change will also be analyzed. On completion, you should be able to explain the concepts of continuity, along with types of discontinuities.&nbsp;</p><p>As you continue, you discuss the slope of a curve at a point and the slope of a tangent at a curve. The derivative and notation are key concepts to understand when dealing with differentiation. The relationship between differentiability and continuity will also be highlighted. Are you aware that there are multiple rules of differentiation? Learn about their formulas and when to use them. This course teaches you about the six trigonometric functions, as well as their derivatives. You will study the relationship between implicit functions and implicit differentiation. Inverse trigonometric functions will also be explained. Logarithmic differentiation is another technique to look out for when dealing with calculus. You will also learn about the local extreme value theorem and its working principles. The absolute extrema is related to both absolute minima and maxima. State how to use a chart to find the absolute extrema of a curve.&nbsp;</p><p>The mean value and Rolleâ€™s theorem are important to understand when working with derivatives. The first and second derivative tests will also be analyzed. This course also teaches you about concavity. You will become familiar with the concave up and concave down curves. Velocity and acceleration can be calculated using derivative functions. The derivative also plays a role in business, and economics. The optimization problem seeks the best value for a variable quantity. Discuss the steps involved in solving an optimization problem. You will also become familiar with linear approximations and differentials. This course will be of great interest to students with an interest in limits, differential calculus, and applications.
