This course will guide you through the ordinary levelled maths curriculum for your exam. People looking to brush up on their maths skills will also find this course of use! Cover the process of finding sides and angles using different ratios, geometric reasoning, equations of different types of lines and much much more.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>A ratio is a relationship between two numbers: it tells you how much of one thing there is compared to another. This course begins by teaching you the steps to find angles and sides using trigonometric ratios such as sine, cosine and tangent. You will then learn about different applications of geometric reasoning, which is the use of critical thinking, logical arguments and spatial reasoning to solve problems and find new relationships. Co-ordinates are a set of values that show an exact position and are usually a pair of numbers you can see on graphs.</p><p>This course will teach you about geometry with coordinates, and you will look into the equations of straight, parallel and perpendicular lines. Study the Pythagorean theorem, a mathematical formula that provides us with the relationship between the sides in a right-angled triangle. Trigonometry is used to measure angles while geometry deals with angles only in terms of equality of angles and sums of angles.</p><p>On the completion of this course, you will have a better understanding of synthetic geometry, right-angled triangles, coordinate geometry, and trigonometric ratios. You will also be able to practice answering miscellaneous trigonometry questions. Although this course is from Project Maths of Ireland, it is suitable for anyone wanting to practise trig and geometry.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
