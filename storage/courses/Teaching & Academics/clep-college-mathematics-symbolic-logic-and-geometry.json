This method makes it possible to manipulate ideas mathematically in much the same way that numbers are manipulated. This free online course introduces you to sentences and statements. A mathematical statement is either true or false. It may contain words and symbols This course outlines some examples of mathematical sentences and statements. You will also learn about replacement value. Conditional statements and biconditional statements will be taught along with examples. The laws of syllogism, detachment, and disjunctive inference will be discussed. Learn about direct proofs and indirect proofs. Reasoning involves drawing logical conclusions based on evidence or stated assumptions. In this course, the different types of mathematical reasoning will be discussed. Learn about De Morganâ€™s laws as well as the properties of modus tollens.</p><p>Do you know what geometry is? Geometry is the mathematical study of all shapes and figures. It can be seen everywhere in our everyday life. We live in a world of shapes and we shall see how mathematics helps us understand the basics of geometry. In this course, you will be introduced to lines, segments, and rays. The formulas to calculate midpoints, endpoints, and opposite rays will be outlined. The course teaches you to prove the angle sum property of a quadrilateral. Learn how to classify triangles by sides and by angles. You will also learn how to find the sum of interior angles and exterior angles. It explains the median, angle bisectors, and altitude.</p><p>Finally, a quadrilateral is a closed two-dimensional figure that has four sides, four angles, and four vertices. You will learn about the properties of parallelograms and how to prove that a quadrilateral is a parallelogram. The material discusses the properties of a square, and explains methods to prove that a quadrilateral is a square. You will learn about the formulas, properties, arcs, sectors, and segments of a circle. Discover how to prove the theorems on tangent lines and tangent circles. Grapple with the properties of rectangles, parallelograms, and rhombuses, and the relationship between trapezoids and triangles. Learn how to find the area of a triangle using Heron's formula, and how to determine the sector of a circle. This math course will be of immense benefit to anyone studying advanced geometry or sitting CLEP tests.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
