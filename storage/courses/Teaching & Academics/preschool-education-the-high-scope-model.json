We start by learning about the importance of preschool education in early childhood development and the core competencies acquired during that crucial period. We also examine the theoretical approaches that have been developed over the years regarding child development by various psychologists.</p><p>Are you curious about the different types of preschool programs that are being used? Based on the work of various psychologists, we go through the different kindergarten curricula that have been developed over the years. A brief history and evolution of preschool education will also be discussed during the course. An active child is one that learns the fastest. We will be analyzing the role that teachers and parents can play in providing the best indoor and outdoor environment that enhances a childâ€™s learning abilities.</p><p>Education is not just about teachers and children: it is teamwork between the parents and the school in order to ensure that the child is learning to the best of his or her abilities. We look at the evaluation methods that are used under the high-scope model and constantly discussed with parents to ensure that everyone stays in the loop. The primary goal of the high-scope model is to ensure that a child develops their own ways of thinking. This course provides you with all the information you need relevant to the high-scope model. So enroll now and take your learning journey in early childhood education forward.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5275\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
