Trigonometry is not always directly applied to solving practical issues but is used in various fields. This course covers the application areas of trigonometry functions and their properties. It analyses reference or related angles, the formula for solving for the area of triangles and the laws of sine. Begin this course and explore the world of trigonometry.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>This course has been specially prepared to take you through the applications of trigonometric functions and other trigonometry concepts. Trigonometric functions are simple functions, the argument of which is an angle. They describe the relationship between the sides and angles of a right triangle. Applications of trigonometric functions are exceptionally diverse. Today, trigonometry is found in many areas from architecture to the manufacturing industry. Although it may seem as if trigonometry is never used outside of the lecture room, you may be surprised to learn just how often trigonometry and its applications are encountered in the real world. This course analyzes the properties of sine, cosine and tangent graphs. It explains the changes in amplitude, period and frequency. Every mathematical function, regardless of its simplicity or complexity, has an inverse. This course demonstrates inverse trigonometric functions and notations used to denote the inverse of a trig function. Be prepared for an exciting trigonometry journey by analysing examples that follow a step-by-step process of solving different types of trigonometry problems.</p><p>Do you want to learn how to solve any triangle's sides and or angles? This course delves into a reference or related angle and the formulas for finding the reference angle when the terminal ray of the angle lies in quadrants II, III and IV. We reveal the formula for calculating the area of a triangle and solving for triangles while using trig ratios. We explain how when you know two sides of a triangle and the non-included angle, there exists the possibility of determining two distinct triangles with these components. We illustrate how you can use the law of sines to find the number of possible triangles that you can construct using given or missing angle measurements. Did you know that finding the missing side lengths and angle measurements of a triangle is feasible? Apply the law of cosines or the law of sines covered in this course and make anything possible.</p><p>This course will teach you how to determine the trig value of any angle measure by determining which quadrant its terminal ray is located and the angle of reference or the related angle. Explore how to find the values of the trigonometric functions using a particular property called the ‘even’ and ‘odd’ properties. We discuss polar coordinates and locating points on a graph sheet. Become familiar with the step-by-step process for converting from rectangular to polar coordinates and how to convert from polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates. When two forces act on the same object, the Pythagorean theorem, the law of sines and the law of cosines can help determine the effect on that object. Trigonometry is extremely versatile. Completing this course will give you an understanding of certain trigonometric concepts and their applications. It will be of great interest to students, researchers, engineers, land surveyors or anyone interested in obtaining an excellent working knowledge of trigonometry.
