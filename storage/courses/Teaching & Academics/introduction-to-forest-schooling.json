Such teachers continually refine their learning styles and skills to serve children and help them develop. This teacher training course explores the innovative forest school approach to education that provides learning experiences in woodlands or other tree-filled natural settings. We first lay out the teaching philosophy’s history and guiding principles before describing its advantages and impact on children’s academic, social, psychological and practical competence. We then discuss the central policies and procedures related to setting up and running a forest school programme while describing the associated risks.</p><p>The course then examines the various forest school learning activities like nature watching, ‘reading’ clouds, treasure hunting and dye making. We trace their impact on a child's development and discuss benefits like stress reduction, mood improvement and increased concentration. We show you how other important playful activities like splashing, memory games, crafting and tree climbing can be conducted in forest school programmes. The course also demonstrates the value of various survival activities such as building shelters, foraging and making fires.</p><p>The course then looks at how forest schools support a child's psychological, physical, social and cognitive development. We explain how forest school sessions can help children to improve several abilities, including their communication, problem-solving, risk-taking and emotional intelligence. We then establish the significance of eco-friendly forest schooling and discuss how to maintain eco-friendly practices by camping in a designated area and using fire pits and non-toxic products and while wildlife with care. Finally, we cover the key aspects of health and safety relevant to education and lay out the risk assessment procedure, risk-benefit analyses and the role of forest school leaders in identifying and mitigating the main physical and environmental dangers specific to wooded areas. Forest schooling offers the young a stimulating and innovative educational alternative and can play a constructive role in driving childhood development.
