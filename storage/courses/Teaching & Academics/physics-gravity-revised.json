We explain how the force works and lay out the ways we attempt to understand it. We break down complex scientific concepts into easy steps to help you master important ideas. Philosophers and scientists spent centuries working out how we stay grounded and this course helps you understand their work and that everything that goes up, must come down.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Gravity is the force that keeps us on the ground and understanding how it works is very important as the force has a great influence on the upward and downward movement of objects. This course explains Sir Isaac Newton's Second Law of Motion and the universal gravitational constant, which is used to work out the force of gravity throughout the known universe.</p><p>We also examine the effect of the Earth's force of gravity, or ‘little g’, on an object to establish why mass is not the same as weight. We help you fully understand gravity by taking you step-by-step through the relevant formulas. Only then do we show you how to calculate velocity or distance based on time and then plot these changes to create a visual representation of what is happening.</p><p>This physics course will be of great interest to anyone who is interested in physics, chemistry, engineering and mathematics. Anyone pursuing a career in any of the sciences or engineering fields requires an understanding of Newtonian physics and this course explains the laws that keep the world spinning.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
