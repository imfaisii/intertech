This course provides every important link between algebra and numbers. It also introduces pupils to applications of calculus in real life. Some such examples include calculating the voltage of something electric or the speed of something.</p><p>The use of differentiation to find the slope of a given tangent to a curve at a point is explained. This then leads on to the study of decreasing and increasing functions. Functions and differentiation are often used in real life as an aid to understanding rates of decrease and increase. Various rules of differentiation will also be reviewed.</p><p>For example, you will explore problems involving the maximum speed that can be reached by a car and look at the highest point that can be reached by a rocket or firework. Finally, the mathematical concept of numerical integration is investigated through the use of the Trapezoidal Rule to find areas under given curves. So whether you are preparing for your leaving certificate or simply looking to study high-level maths, this course is for you!</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
