First, our discussion will focus on the framework and work of famous figures in the field. We will discuss the history of early childhood education models and approaches and look at early childhood education programs from the 1970s and 1980s. Have you ever wondered which curriculum to choose for your child's early childhood education? This course will investigate the work of Maria Montessori and the basic principles of scientific education. We will explore Montessori's five basic principles for early childhood education and the three stages of development. We will compare the theories of Montessori and Jean Piaget.</p><p>There are four primary learning areas of Montessori education. Would you like to know how a child moves from direct and concrete experiences to more abstract concepts? We will delve into this topic and study the different language materials and activities that can play an essential role in children's language development. Next, we will research mathematical Montessori materials and the principles of the Montessori philosophy. This course introduces Waldorf education and the basics of Waldorf schools. We will then discuss its vision and the applications of Waldorf preschool education. In addition, we will view the concept of anthroposophy, fostering imagination and child-centeredness. We will also analyze the significance of music and classical art in the classroom for children.</p><p>The course will then look at the basics of social development in children. You will learn the various features of social development that can help children manage their lives better. We illustrate the role of family traditions, values, customs and attitudes on a child's social development. Would you like to know what role preschool institutions play in socialization? We will discuss that in detail and how preschool teachers can promote children's social and emotional development. Next, we will also probe the impact of positive and negative emotions on a child's psychological health.
