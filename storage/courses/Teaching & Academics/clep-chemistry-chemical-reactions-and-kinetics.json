This type of reaction is called a reduction-oxidation reaction or a redox reaction. They are energy‚Äêproducing reactions in industry as well as in the body. The core of a redox reaction is the passing of one or more electrons from one species to another. It is important to keep track of the number of electrons being transferred in a redox reaction. This course teaches you how to assign an oxidation number to each substance involved in the reaction as well as the rules for assigning them. A combined understanding of these concepts improves your chances of passing your chemistry exam.</p><p>Oxidation numbers are assigned to each element in a chemical reaction to help us learn which element is oxidized and which reduced. The changes in oxidation numbers are also used to balance redox equations. The study of redox reactions begins by learning about oxidation numbers. There are several ways to approach balancing redox reactions. This course discusses the half-reaction method and the ion-electron method. It explores electrolytic and voltaic cells as well as the electrodes used in electrolysis. You will be able to recall the easy steps outlined in finding oxidation numbers as well as solving the organic chemistry and kinetic problems presented in this course. You will also get familiar with the identification and characterization of alkanes, alkynes and alkenes along with their functional groups. You will learn about the classification along with the sub-classification of hydrocarbons into saturated compounds and unsaturated compounds.</p><p>Organic compounds that have the same chemical formula but different chemical structures are called isomers. You will study the three main types of isomers. You will also learn about the rate law along with the factors that affect reaction rates. When provided with concentration and time data, what is the easiest way to determine the rate law? How do you calculate the half-life reaction? These and other questions are clearly answered in the online modules.
