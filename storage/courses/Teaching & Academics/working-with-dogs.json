If you watch carefully, this canine communication can mean something specific and significant. This dog training course studies dog language, their intelligence, behaviour and emotions. As dog owners, we often have certain doubts. How do I teach basic commands to my dogs and socialize them with other dogs? What are some of the potential behavioural problems I could encounter? This course can help you answer such questions. Our section on canine communication highlights the intelligence of a dog and provides useful insights into their body language, evolution, perception and means of communicating. We show you how to understand canine postures and actions as we interpret their growls, whines and barks, why they lick and sniff and how they socialize. We also compare the communication methods used by purebred and crossbred dogs.</p><p>At times, dogs exhibit certain undesirable behaviours like pulling excessively on the lead, urinating and defecating inside the house or yelping. We investigate these problems to help you address them. There is a lot of back and forth in the communication between humans and dogs and this course explains how it works in both directions. Dogs can pick up on our emotions and change their demeanour towards us. Studies show that dogs use more than fifteen different gestures to communicate with humans. Can dogs speak naturally? Do dogs understand when you talk to them? How do you tell a dog you love them? We show you how to communicate effectively with dogs using spoken words, body language and hand signals.</p><p>It is a privilege and a responsibility to own a dog. Dog owners play an active and essential role in the upbringing of their canine friends. In the final module of this course, you will learn the essentials of choosing a dog, keeping them safe and sharing your love with them. With patience and consistency, it is possible to successfully implement a training plan to teach basic commands to dogs. This course delves into common training mistakes and provides an overview of canine emotions. As a dog owner, you will gain confidence as you learn to communicate effectively with your furry family member and enjoy the comforting companionship that dogs can offer. If you are an animal lover and are looking for a career path where you can work with dogs, this course lays out the wonderful options available. Sign up to break down the communication barriers between you and dogs, either at home or at work.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
