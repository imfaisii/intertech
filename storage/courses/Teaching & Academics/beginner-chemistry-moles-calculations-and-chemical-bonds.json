At its commencement, moles and equations are discussed, including concepts such as atomic mass, Avogadro's Constant, spectrometry, empirical and molecular formulas, mole-concentration triangle, titration and stoichiometry. You'll discover the distinctions between atomic and relative mass and how to calculate the relative atomic masses accurately. Then you'll learn about Avogadro's Constant and how to calculate the mass, moles or molar mass using the mole-mass triangle. After that, you will study how to apply the empirical formula to deduce the molecular formula and write chemical formulas for ionic and covalent compounds. The solutions and titration method for determining their concentrations are detailed next.</p><p>The course explores three types of chemical bonds: ionic, covalent and metallic. You will learn about the formation of these bonds and their depiction using dot-and-cross diagrams. Following that, you'll understand how the bond energy influences bond strength and molecular reactivity. As explained by the electron-pair repulsion theory, you will find diverse molecule shapes, such as linear, triangular pyramidal, V-shape and trigonal planar.</p><p>The following section explains the concept of hybridisation and the formation of sigma and pi bonds. Then we will clarify the notions of electronegativity, the Pauling numerical scale that describes it and polarity in molecules. You will investigate metallic bonding along with the factors that affect its strength. Lastly, the course discusses all three types of intermolecular forces: van der Waals, permanent dipole-dipole and hydrogen bonding with their characteristics and the connection between bonding and physical properties of substances. This course is the second in our 'Beginner Chemistry' series. We recommend you tackle 'Beginner Chemistry 101: Matter and Atoms' first to cement your foundation in this subject.
