Trig is one of the most important mathematical relationships. Triangles do not seem complex, but the application of triangles in mathematics has vital importance, especially where precise distance measurements are needed like in aviation. This course has been broken down into concise procedures to make your learning journey easy, detailed and interesting. It kicks off by introducing you to various trigonometric identities that are used to solve common problems. Trigonometric identities are useful whenever trig functions are involved in an expression or an equation. There are various distinct identities involving the length as well as the angle of a triangle. A trigonometric identity is true for every possible value of the input variable on which it is defined. This course outlines the formulas for the basic identities and proceeds to show you how to prove for identities.</p><p>You will also learn how to find the sine, cosine, and tangent of the sum or difference of two angles. The sine and cosine functions can be used to model many real-life situations, including electric currents, musical tones, radio waves, tides, and weather patterns. A distributive property does not apply to any of the six trigonometric functions, however, there are interesting relationships between the sum of two trigonometric functions and their product (or the product of two trigonometric functions and their sum). The material outlines the formula to convert the sum to product and product to sum. Learn how to solve first- and second-degree trigonometric equations and those with more than one trig function. This course analyzes inverse trigonometric functions, which are frequently used in engineering, navigation, architecture, aeronautics and physics. Trigonometric functions and inverses can be used to find the side and measures of an angle.</p><p>Furthermore, the course discusses the graphs for the six trigonometric functions. For each graph, you consider period, amplitude, frequency, domain and range. The material illustrates in detail the application of the laws of sine and cosine. Learn how to solve for the missing lengths and angle measures of a triangle. In rectangular coordinates: to locate a point, we move so many units left or right, and so many units up or down. When working in polar coordinates, we would often stop to think how far do we have to move from the pole, and in which direction? The material helps you plot points accurately on a polar coordinate system and illustrates how to convert from rectangular to polar coordinates and vice versa.
