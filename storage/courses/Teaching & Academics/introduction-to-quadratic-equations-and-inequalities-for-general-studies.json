This mathematics course has been created to teach you the functions and different methods of solving such equations. You will learn about factoring, graphing and completing the square alongside the various steps involved in the derivation of the quadratic formula. You will go on to explore the discriminant of roots, as well as how to find the sum and product of roots and their relationship to the coefficients of the equation.</p><p>Next, you will move on to other methods of solving quadratic equations such as frame problems and projectile motion. Spend time on the two methods of solving quadratic-linear systems: solving quadratic-linear systems graphically and algebraically. Take a deep dive into the concepts of quadratic inequalities and solve them using algebraic methods of set theory and number line analysis. Learn to identify the concepts of transcendental and trigonometric functions. The graphing, applications and inverse of exponential functions will also be covered extensively as you become familiar with Type I and Type II exponential functions.</p><p>Finally, you will master the topic of logarithmic functions. Beginning with the concepts, you will go on to understand the five laws of logarithms and natural logarithms. Practise how to plot the graph of a logarithmic function, and gain insight on how to change between exponential and logarithmic forms. You will also cover the derivation of the change of base formula and its applications, and how to solve logarithmic equations both algebraically and graphically. The application of the logarithmic scale in measuring the acidity of a solution and measuring the intensity of sound waves will also be covered. This course will be of great interest to students, researchers, and anyone with an interest in understanding quadratic equations and inequalities.
