This primary education training course is brought to you by Skill Up and is designed to help anyone interested in a career teaching primary school pupils. It is based on the UK's educational system, which is widely recognised as ‘world-class’. We begin by examining the important teaching responsibilities, professional development and career opportunities facing those about to enter the UK’s education system.</p><p>The course then focuses on the different types of schools that exist in the UK. We lay out their different processes and examine their admission criteria and standards in implementing the national curriculum. We then discuss how the ‘Early Years Foundation Stage’ (EYFS) framework sets out to help children achieve their full potential by setting learning outcomes laid out in the 'Every Child Matters Framework'.&nbsp;</p><p>The course then provides teaching strategies designed to enhance your pupils’ abilities in terms of English, mathematics and primary science. We discuss how the national curriculum organises Science into four key areas, including the nature of scientific processes and methods of scientific enquiry. We then go through the laws that concern the teaching of children with Special Education Needs (SEN). This course suits anyone who loves to work with young children and wants to play a positive role in their development.
