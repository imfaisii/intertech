The relationship between humans, the earth and food sources proves that the soil is the bedrock of agriculture. Soil and water have given humanity the ability to generate food for our survival through agriculture. This course explores the link between soil and agriculture by focusing on the major soil properties that help make the soil fertile. First, we introduce you to the basic ideas of 'agriculture' and 'agronomy' that will help you to understand the several techniques used for seeds and crop management. We introduce you to horticulture, which will in turn help you gain insights into different types of nursery production. Explore the factors essential for setting up a productive nursery and the concept of plant propagation, how it works and the two common methods used in plant propagation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Soil is a mixture of different materials including minerals, rock, water and air and lies on top of the land containing living and dead matter. It offers structural support for agricultural plants and is a source of water and nutrients. We help you gain an in-depth knowledge of soil classification, soil fertility and plant nutrition. We discuss the physical properties of the soil, such as soil texture, structure and pH. Natural cycling of nutrients from the earth to plants and animals and then back to the ground has occurred throughout Earth's history, primarily through biomass breakdown. This cycle aids in the preservation of vital nutrients for plant development in the soil. We will provide you with insight into the essential soil minerals for plants. Discover the chemical elements necessary for plant nutrition and nutrient deficiency symptoms.&nbsp;</p><p>Pests are organisms that can compete with or damage plant species. They reduce plant density, cause stunted growth in plants, reduce production capacity and in many other ways reduce the quality of farm produce. This course will show you the necessary measures for controlling pests, including pesticides and their applications. On top of that, we review other pest control measures such as insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides and more. Weeds reduce yields, increase production costs, interfere with harvesting and reduce product quality. They also impede the flow of irrigation water and harbour disease-causing organisms. In light of this, we will help you understand weeds and their classification. Discover the different weed-controlling methods to implement depending on the situation at hand. This course is open to farmers, students and anyone who wishes to learn more about crop production, plant nutrition and agricultural science. A world without agriculture is dismal as our primary food source stems from this practice.
