A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of outputs, where every input has at most one output. The course will teach you how to plot quadratic graphs, match equations and sketches, sketch a parabola using the square, look into the concept of the Trapezoidal Rule, and more. Start your learning journey, today!","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>This course first teaches the rules of differentiation which includes product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule. You will learn the use of differentiation to find the slope of a tangent to a curve at a specified point. This is then extended to the study of increasing and decreasing functions. You will also learn how to determine the local maxima and local minima turning points of a curve.</p><p>You will then study average speed, which is the rate of change of distance. This course also teaches the use of slope to determine the nature of a function. You will learn the concept of numerical integration and how to use the Trapezoidal Rule to find the area under specific curves. With the help of video presentations, you will then be guided through the process of completing the square and sketching the full method.</p><p>Functions and calculus are used in real life to help us understand rates of increase and decrease. Upon the completion of this course, you will be able to solve problems involving the maximum speed reached by car and the highest point reached by a firework or rocket. You will also learn that a Trapezoidal Rule is a numerical approach to finding definite integrals where no other method is possible. So, check out the course and gain a better understanding of functions and calculus, today.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
