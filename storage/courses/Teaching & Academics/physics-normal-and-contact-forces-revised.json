By the end, you will have learnt why some objects do not move even when they are on a slope and will understand the effects different forces have on objects. Did you know that when you try to move a heavy object, it takes more effort to get it moving than to keep it moving? Learn why this is by enrolling for free today.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Newton's First Law states that an object at rest will stay at rest while an object in motion will stay in motion unless there is some unbalanced or net force. This course introduces you to ‘normal force’, which is the force exerted when an object is resting on any surface that is perpendicular to the surface of the object. You will learn that if two surfaces are not in contact, they can't exert normal force on each other.</p><p>Gravity decreases in strength the further you move away from the centre of the earth. This course will discuss the force of gravity, which is equal to mass times the gravitational field of the earth, about 9.8 metres per second. You will learn that a net force is mass times acceleration, and that to calculate the rate of acceleration of an object, you divide the force of the direction it’s moving by the mass of the object. You will also study kinetic friction and static friction.</p><p>Kinetic friction is a force that acts between moving surfaces and static friction is a force that keeps an object at rest. By taking this course, you will learn how to calculate the static and kinetic friction on a stationary object to be moved along a surface. So, check out the material and start learning about the dynamics of moving objects on specific surfaces, today.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
