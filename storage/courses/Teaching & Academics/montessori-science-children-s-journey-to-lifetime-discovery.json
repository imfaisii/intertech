When it comes to observation, no one is as observant as preschoolers. Various studies indicate that Montessori children possess a heightened sense of observation. This course teaches you how to provide children with the correct support to let them develop their observation skills to their full world-changing potential. The Montessori environment creates this opportunity.</p><p>Cultivating a respect for science in children is important so experts at Montessori Pro have based this course on Dr Maria Montessori's proven ideals. Our study material is divided into four topics, starting with Dr Montessori's vision of teaching science to children. We establish the importance of introducing children to biology and explain the organisation of the Montessori ‘science shelf’.</p><p>Our next three topics discuss concepts concerning plants, animals, the human body and physics. Numerous activities are included, along with simple step-by-step instructions. We teach you how to perform various activities with children that demonstrate magnetism, colours, buoyancy, growth of plants and so on. Our ‘Resources’ section contains various pictures, tables and tabs to make the content appealing. Some formative questions are added to the end of each topic to help you assess their progress throughout the course. This course will benefit both parents and teachers as they use the respected Montessori method to set children on a lifelong journey of discovery.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5115\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
