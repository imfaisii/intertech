Their job is challenging but there are recognised approaches to success. This criminology course teaches you the fundamentals of criminal intelligence, including how to collect, evaluate and analyse data to make sense of it. We then provide the specific skills required to become a criminal intelligence analyst. Understanding criminal psychology is critical in solving complex cases because it links suspects' mindset and motives to their actions. We examine different types of crimes and trace the psychological and social factors behind them. The criminal justice system considers evidence from crime research when making decisions and knowing how to apply a variety of research techniques is essential if you want evidence to stand up in court. We go over a range of research and analysis techniques and explain how to use them to research crime.</p><p>Decision-making is one the most difficult parts of crime intelligence analysis, especially when the available data is incomplete and out of context. This course shows you how to make decisions when the available data is ambiguous or incomplete under different circumstances. We describe the unique features of intelligence-led policing and establish the importance in controlling modern crime. Specialist counterterrorism measures have been taken by governments around the world since the 9/11 attacks. We demonstrate how intelligence can be used to predict terrorist activities and go through the information required to create a counterterrorism policy and respond to a terrorist threat. The course teaches you how to use information technology to collect the required data, analyse it and use it to conduct smart investigations. We also discuss the key features of the criminal justice system of England and Wales.</p><p>We designed this course for people who work or intend to work in law enforcement agencies as criminal intelligence analysts. It is also useful for anyone who has studied criminology or criminal intelligence and wants to refresh their knowledge. The instructor explains both the theoretical and practical aspects of criminal intelligence as well as the relevant laws. You can also take this course to learn how to precinct crime and guard against it. All governments and security agencies need professionals who can interpret crime data so criminal intelligence offers rewarding career opportunities for people with the right knowledge and skills. Sign up to learn how to analyse criminal data to detect patterns and predict future criminal behaviour.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5224\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
