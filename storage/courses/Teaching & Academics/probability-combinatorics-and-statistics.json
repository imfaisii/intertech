Or, do you want to collect and graphically present your business's data to stakeholders? We encounter these scenarios frequently and the way to deal with them is through the mathematical branch of probability, combinatorics and statistics. We have designed this course to teach you how to collect, study and present data in a meaningful way and analyse it to obtain the best interpretation. The course starts with a study of probability and combinatorics. Then, we will explain the fundamental principle of ‘counting’, which we can use to figure out various outcomes in probability situations. We demonstrate the analysis of permutations and combinations along with key formulae and symbology used so that you can comprehensively grasp this critical subject.</p><p>Next, the course moves toward the crucial topic of probability theory. Do you come across statements in your daily life like ‘this method is probably correct’ or ‘it is likely that he may not come today?’. All these terms like 'probably’, 'likely’, 'possible’, 'chance’ and so on convey the idea that there is uncertainty about the happening of an event. In such cases, we talk about chance or probability as a quantitative measure of our degree of certainty. Discover various types of probability calculations and the important formulas that you can use to evaluate these scenarios. Analyse the probability of events that can and cannot occur simultaneously and conditional and empirical probability. Examples will help you understand and apply the concepts in their respective situations and scenarios.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how you could visually present the average scores of players on your sports team? Or how to collect and present data for a financial budget presentation? We look at the science related to the study and presentation of data known as statistics. Firstly, we will clarify the different methods of displaying data. Graphical representation is the most attractive method of describing and representing data. It allows the user to glance at the relationship between different kinds of information quickly. You will construct various graphs and tables based on quantitative or qualitative information. We will supply diagrams and examples of each type of graph and table for clarity. We will also describe the measures of central tendency. We demonstrate mean, median and mode along with variance and standard deviation formulas. We provide a diagrammatical analysis of scatterplots and bell curves towards the end of the course. The use of probability and statistics is all around us in our daily lives. From sports to the medical field, small businesses to governments, all use these techniques to conduct relevant analyses and figures for the respective users. So don't waste any more time and enrol now in this course and become thoroughly acquainted with the tools you need to grow and contribute.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
