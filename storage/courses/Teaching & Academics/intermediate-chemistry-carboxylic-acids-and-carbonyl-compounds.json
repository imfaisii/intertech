One example is \"acetic acid\", which comes from the Latin word \"acetum\", meaning vinegar. In this course, we discuss carboxylic acids, carbonyl compounds(aldehydes and ketones) and the tool used to identify them, infrared spectroscopy. You'll discover their naming, preparation processes, and reactions to various substances.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Benzaldehyde is a component of the artificial flavours of mangoes, cherries, apricots, plums, and peaches. This chemistry course details the aldehydes and ketones, and carboxylic acids. You will first explore the carbonyl compounds' distinctive odours and the differences between aldehydes and ketones. Then, we discuss their naming conventions and rules. You will discover the procedures of aldehydes and ketones preparation from primary and secondary alcohols. We delve into their reduction reactions and the addition of cyanide to aldehydes and ketones, which resulted in nitrile compounds.</p><p>The following section examines carboxylic acids, their naming, and various preparation techniques, such as refluxing nitrile compounds in aqueous, diluted hydrochloric acid. Compared to other acids, we observe carboxylic acids' acidity and how they increase it and their dissociation constant. The subsequent topic explains the interactions of carboxylic acids with reactive metals, alkalis, and carbonates to produce salts. We also discuss carboxylic acid derivatives, such as acyl chlorides and benzoic acid, as well as their preparations and reactions.</p><p>Next, we look at infrared spectroscopy used to analyse compounds and pinpoint their functional groups. You'll realise that the infrared spectrum shows many peaks. We look at the peaks and their corresponding functional groups to distinguish between compounds, such as Hydroxyl (O—H) and Amine (N—H) and Ethylamine and Ethanol. Finally, we investigate the distinctive infrared peaks of butanone, butan-2-ol, and butanoic acid and the variations in each of their spectra.
