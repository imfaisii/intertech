Kinematics is a branch of mechanics that focuses on acceleration, position and velocity. You will look into the basic formulae and concepts of kinematics, and learn how to calculate what distance an Airbus A380 needs to take-off, how long an FA-18 Hornet needs to take off from an aircraft carrier, and much more!","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>This course begins by explaining the concept of kinematics, which is the study of the movement and motion of objects. You will look at practical examples to help you gain a clear understanding of its principles and the importance of physics in solving real-world problems. Learn how to understand practical examples and solve problems related to movement; work through examples using formulas; calculate acceleration, velocity and displacement of an object; and use velocity-time graphs to visualise data.</p><p>Then it is time to look at real examples. You will then see that race cars accelerate when cornering even if travelling at a constant speed as there is a change in direction. This course will also show you that the Airbus A380 has a takeoff velocity of 280 km/hour and that an FA-18 Hornet has a take-off speed of 260 km/hour from an aircraft carrier and needs an aircraft length of 80 metres. You will see that displacement can be calculated as the area under the curve in a velocity-time graph.</p><p>In physics, the study of movement and the motion of objects is called kinematics, a branch of mechanics. The study of the motion of objects focuses on topics such as acceleration, position and velocity. On the completion of this course, you will better understand the movement of objects by looking at the real-world application of kinematics.
