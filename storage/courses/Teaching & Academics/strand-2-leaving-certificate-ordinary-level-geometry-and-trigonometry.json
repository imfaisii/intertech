This course is based on the Strand 2 Leaving Certificate for geometry and trigonometry. It covers up to a third of Paper 2 in the Irish curriculum. In a clear and simple manner, you will be guided through the properties of shapes and learn about geometric reasoning, as well as cover coordinate geometry, trigonometry and more. Start learning, today!","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Synthetic geometry is also known as axiomatic or pure geometry and is the study of geometry without the use of co-ordinates or formulae. It studies shapes by means of axioms and theorems. This course begins by teaching you the different concepts of synthetic geometry. You will look into the different properties of shapes and learn about geometric reasoning. which is the use of critical thinking, logical arguments and spatial reasoning to solve problems and find new relationships.</p><p>Co-ordinate geometry is also known as analytic geometry or cartesian geometry. It is the study of geometry using a co-ordinate system, in contrast to synthetic geometry. This course will teach you the different concepts of co-ordinate geometry and you will learn its usefulness in physics, engineering, aviation and space science. You will also cover trigonometry and study the relations of the sides and angles of triangles and the relevant functions of any angles.</p><p>Synthetic and co-ordinate geometry are used in real life to help us understand the dimensions and transformations of shapes and figures such as lines, triangles, polygons and circles. Upon the completion of this course, you will have a better understanding of key geometry axioms and theorems. So, check out the course today and learn how to properly solve for the slope and equation of a line passing through two given points, find distances and angles using sine and cosine rules, and more.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
