You will learn that guardianship is the legal relationship between a parent and his/her child. With this course, you will learn that the duty of the guardian is to properly care for the child and to make decisions about the childâ€™s education, health, religious upbringing, and general welfare. You will also learn that a child needs a guardian until the age of 18 years.</p><p>You will then look into the parental status and school communication. This course will teach you how to communicate with the parents if they are married to each other and are living together; are married to each other and are living apart; are married to each other but are not living together and have a separation agreement; are married to each other, living apart, and might be in a new relationship(s); are not married and either live together or apart; and are not married and are in other relationships.</p><p>The diversity of family units and the increase in parental separation has resulted in increased demands being made on schools where their child or children are enrolled. Upon the completion of this course, you will gain a better understanding of the school's responsibilities for collection arrangements and communication requirements depending on the parental status, and more. Sign up for this course and learn how to cooperate and emotionally support both the parents and kids in the event of a separation.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/1879\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
