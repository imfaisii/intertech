This could be 'dominant aggression' (where dogs charge at with intent to harm), or 'fearful aggression' (where dogs lunge, bark and show teeth but then retreat and try to avoid conflict). Sometimes your four legged friend might simply snap in order to claim their personal space. We focus on empowering you and provide the tools, knowledge and training methods to make sure your dog listens and follows your commands. We take you through step-by-step video demonstrations that describe ‘pack leader’ theory and positive-reinforcement techniques.</p><p>We show you how to recognise dominant and submissive signals to prevent potential attacks and explain techniques that have been proven to integrate aggressive dogs with other dogs. You play a crucial role in your dog's aggressive behaviour: when you are nervous and fearful, that anxiety can transfer to your dog and create tension in them. We describe how to turn those negative feelings into the kind of positivity that can calm your pet. The course begins its practical lessons with dog walking, as getting your dog to walk by your side is vital to your eventual success. We go through further training methods that can convince your dog, in a kind and confident manner, that you are in charge and that it is not their job to protect you, an anxiety that can prompt fear and thus aggression.</p><p>This course offers the knowledge and confidence you need to make your dog feel secure and calm. We demonstrate how you can become your dog's ‘pack leader’ without shouting or forcing. The course provides confirmation of what you might already be doing right and suggests areas where some dog-training 'fine tuning' could help. We can help you to go on a walk feeling confident with your dog at your heel, following your lead and focused on you rather than other dogs. This course suits anyone who wants a better relationship with a calmer and happier dog, especially if you are struggling with an aggressive pet. Those who are professional dog-walkers will also benefit from this course by learning how to keep the dogs in their care safe from harm.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4208\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
