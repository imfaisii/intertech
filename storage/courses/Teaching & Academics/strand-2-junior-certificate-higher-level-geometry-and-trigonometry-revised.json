It will show you how synthetic geometry and trig are used to help us understand the dimensions and transformations of shapes and figures (such as lines, triangles, polygons and circles). The course will be particularly useful for Irish Junior Certificate students preparing for their exams but is open to everyone.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Geometry and Trigonometry is one of the strands of the Project Maths course in the Irish curriculum. Synthetic geometry and co-ordinate geometry are used in real life to help us understand the dimensions and transformations of shapes and figures. Synthetic geometry studies shapes by means of axioms and theorems. Co-ordinate geometry studies lines and circles by reference to a fixed set of co-ordinates.&nbsp;</p><p>Trigonometry is concerned with ‘real life’ measurements of length, angles and circularity in both two and three dimensions. Trigonometry is commonly used in quantity surveying, construction and architecture. This strand is one of the most applicable areas of the Junior Certificate mathematics syllabus and allows students to gain experience of realistic solutions to real-world problems.</p><p>Although it is based on the curriculum in Ireland, it is open to anyone needing help with high-school trig and geometry.
