The methods in trigonometry are used for navigation, satellite systems , astronomy, the maritime and aviation industries, oceanography and land surveying. Is trigonometry relevant in your day-to-day activities? Yes, it is! This course prepares you for real-life problems that can be solved using trigonometry. What is trig? Trigonometry, as the name suggests, is about right-angled triangles and is one of the most valuable branches of mathematics and is an important tool for measuring angles.&nbsp;</p><p>This course introduces you to effective and progressive uses of trigonometry and analyzes and simplifies equations using various trigonometric functions. It outlines the formulas for the basic identities and shows you how to prove them. You will learn how to find the sine, cosine and tangent of the sum or difference of two angles. If you want to learn about special right-angle triangles, similar triangles and the methods for proving them, this course is a good starting point. It is also important to understand the relationship between trigonometric functions and their products. This course explains the formula for converting the sum to products and vice versa. You will learn about the measurements of angles, how to convert from degree and radians, and how to determine the arc of a circle. The material explores in detail inverse trigonometric functions. It analyzes reference or related angles and the formulae for finding the reference angle when the terminal ray of the angle lies in quadrants II, III and IV.</p><p>Furthermore, this course teaches you how to find the values of the trigonometric functions using a special property called the even and odd properties. When working in polar coordinates, we would often stop to think how far do we have to move from the pole, and in which direction? This course will help you plot points accurately on a polar coordinate system. It discusses the graph for the six trig functions, considering period, amplitude, frequency, domain and range for each. It discusses the angle of elevation and depression as well as the line of sight. Do you want to learn how to solve for the missing lengths and angle measures of a triangle? This course will show you how.Trigonometry is not restricted to one career path; therefore, this course is for everyone who needs to have a working knowledge of trigonometry. It is important to complete this course for a comprehensive understanding of the concepts, rules and application of trig in general studies.
