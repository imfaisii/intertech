This online electrical course focuses on the fundamentals of electricity and the behaviour of the vital elements of electrical circuits. Did you know that the structure of an atom has a crucial role to play in the flow of electricity? We begin this course by explaining the structure of an atom and how a sub-particle of an atom is responsible for the flow of electricity from one material to another along with the three crucial elements of electricity. Every segment of electricity has a unique unit of measurement and you will discover each of these along with how these unit names were coined. In addition, we will explain Ohm's Law of Electricity and how it expresses the relationship between three electrical variables and the direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) circuits’ behaviours. We will show you how to apply Kirchoff's laws in a DC circuit and calculate resistors in series and parallel circuits. Some practical tips and demonstrations on computing cells or batteries that are connected in series or parallel are discussed, as well as the behaviour of AC circuits, and parameters of the sine wave of an AC circuit.</p><p>Have you ever wondered about the cause of a voltage rise or drop in your home? This certificate in electrical engineering reveals the causes of voltage rise or drop in a circuit and the types of resistors used before moving on to determining the ohmic value of a resistor through its colour codes. A capacitor is another essential part of an electrical circuit. This electrical engineering course moves on to teach you some practicalities and applications such as how capacitors store charges and the factors that affect the capacitance of a capacitor, and how to calculate the total capacitance in a series or parallel circuit. Magnetism plays a considerable role in the generation of electricity - without magnetism, generators wouldn't be able to generate electricity. The focus on magnetism includes studying magnetic materials and how to differentiate between the two main types of magnets, the key terms in magnetism, and three different magnetism measuring systems. Having understood the basics of electricity, studying how to stay safe while working on electrical circuits is also essential. The course ends with a discussion on the precautionary measures and protective equipment to use when working at worksites or on any electrical circuits.</p><p>This course captures the rudiments of electricity and puts you on a path to grasping what electricity is all about along with basic electrical engineering. Even if you have no prior knowledge of electricity and want a basic understanding of electricity and its essential elements, this course has you covered. When you have unpacked what electricity is about, you set yourself up for a great start in the field of electrical and electronics engineering and will open a world of career opportunities in these and related fields. Enrolling in this course also provides easy-to-understand examples to demonstrate how to calculate various parameters of electricity and be able to relate the theoretical part of electricity to real-life scenarios.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/3851\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
