In this exciting course, you will first be taught to distinguish between ‘development practitioners’ and ‘development academics’ as well as the different developmental research types available.</p><p>Next, this course will highlight the steps involved in doing rigorous research in developmental studies, and the theoretical constructs or conceptual frameworks that are used in it. Deciding on the appropriate approach is one of the first decisions you need to take before beginning academic or development work research so a thorough understanding of developmental research theory is critical. The importance of ethical guidelines to protect the identity of interview subjects and preserve the integrity of the data you collect will also be highlighted.</p><p>Finally, the course allows you to understand the causal links between cultural and political institutions and the lives of ordinary people all over the world by examining the past, present and future. If you would like to explore how poverty, globalisation and the environment can affect a country and the world, you may be interested in a career in developmental studies.
