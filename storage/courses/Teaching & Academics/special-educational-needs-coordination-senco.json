Then we'll examine the crucial provisions of the UK’s 2014 Children and Families Act. We will also discuss special education needs (SEN) in the OFSTED framework and special educational needs coordination training from a national viewpoint.</p><p>As a special educational needs coordinator, you must be adequately informed about your position by the special educational needs and disability Code of Practice and how to shape it. We will spend time studying the special educational needs coordinator's roles and responsibilities, the 2014 Special Educational Needs and Disability legislation and the obligations of trust boards and governing bodies. Learn about the various perspectives on how to educate and study effectively for special educational needs children and the impact of behavioural science on special educational needs curriculum and pedagogy.</p><p>The senior leadership team's inclusion of the special educational needs coordination has been the subject of a protracted discussion. We'll talk about the special educational needs coordinator's job, the senior leadership team and providing leadership without being on the senior leadership team. We will also talk about how crucial it is to build relationships with students and parents. Teachers and anybody planning to work with special needs students should take this course.
