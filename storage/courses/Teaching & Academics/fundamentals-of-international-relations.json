This course gives you a basic understanding of IR, including its nature and scope. Have you ever thought about what makes our world ‘modern’? You'll study the historical context that shows the making of the modern world. Upon that, you'll learn about IR theories, actors and spearheads involved in IR and the causes of conflicts.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>International relations (IR) is the scientific study of the interactions between sovereign states. We regard it as one of the major subdisciplines of social sciences that focuses on the history, economy, government, social and cultural aspects of states worldwide. This course will introduce you to the scope and building blocks of studying international relations as a discipline. You will learn about IR in everyday life and its development and examine the interaction between international players. Countries that maintain a strong diplomatic relationship with other countries are usually better off economically, socially and politically. We illustrate the historical making of the modern world and analyse the causes of both the First and Second World Wars, how they ended, the countries involved and the aftermath on a global scale.</p><p>On the international stage, some entities are individually or collectively capable of influencing the dynamics of foreign affairs. They can devise a strategy and act autonomously to achieve specific objectives. These entities are referred to as 'actors'. We carefully examine the state and non-state actors in IR and their impacts. Theories in international relations help us view how nation-states engage with one another. Diplomats and international relations experts usually employ someone to guide and direct a government on global political and socio-economic issues. We'll discuss liberalism and realism theories, including the propositions of Marxism, liberalism, realism, constructivism and feminism on the actors in international relations. In addition, you will study the various concepts in global political economy, how leaders planned the world economic regime after the Second World War and the rise of financial organisations and their functions globally.</p><p>Environmental and terrorist issues have recently gained attention in international relations, which appear to be a significant determinant of state-to-state relations. We discuss these issues, including the rise of green politics and climate change. Unresolved conflicts are seen as the root cause of wars. What kinds of conflict exist between nations that can lead to the outbreak of war? You'll learn about the types of conflicts and wars and the underlying causes at the individual, state and international levels. Lastly, we show you how countries created international organisations such as the United Nations and The League of Nations and their functions in international relations. IR helps analyse and interpret the contemporary and dynamic world of politics. We have designed this course for all learners.
