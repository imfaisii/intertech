This biology course examines the process and studies mitosis, which is the process whereby a single cell divides into two identical ‘daughter’ cells. We then go over meiosis, during which a single cell divides twice to produce four cells containing half the original amount of genetic information. We also investigate sexual reproduction.</p><p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are stem cells derived from the undifferentiated inner mass cells of a human embryo. They are capable of growing into all derivatives of the three major germ layers: the ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. The course pays close attention to these stem cells and explores their many potential uses. We also explain the causes of cancer, a disease caused by the uncontrolled division of abnormal cells, and trace the development and spread of damaged cells.</p><p>Cell division has a major impact on the health and biology of all living things and this course provides a better understanding of the growth and development of these organisms. We establish the importance of cell division in the future treatment of disease and injury repair via stem cell therapies. Sign up for this biology course to learn about mitosis, meiosis and their important role in cell division and replication.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/1685\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
