In this course, you will learn more about organic compounds, different ways to represent them, and naming conventions. You'll look into the properties of various structural isomers and stereoisomers. Discover how covalent bonds of organic compounds break either by homolytic or heterolytic fission.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Organic substances and carbon are the foundation of all living things and the most abundant element in organic molecules. This course begins with an introduction to organic molecules and their carbon bonds. Then we look at different ways to represent organic compounds, such as empirical, molecular, and structural formulas. You will learn how those three formulas are linked and what information they offer. Additionally, we explain how to predict the number of double bonds for various compounds by applying the degree of unsaturation formula.</p><p>After that, we discuss the 2D representation of organic compounds, including the displayed and skeletal formulas, which use lines between atoms to draw bonds. We then describe the 3D displays of the structural formula, ball-and-stick and space-filling diagrams. Following that, you'll learn about functional groups like alcohols (-OH) and ketones (C=O) and how to name organic compounds based on the stem used in alkane naming.</p><p>The course continues by explaining three types of structural isomers: position isomers, functional group isomers and chain isomers, each with specific properties. Next, we discuss the two types of stereoisomers: geometrical (cis and trans) and optical isomers. After that, we explore the organic reaction mechanisms and the homolytic and heterolytic fission. The study then shifts to electrophiles, electron-deficient species, and nucleophiles, electron-rich species. The six different types of organic reactions: addition, elimination, substitution, hydrolysis, oxidation, and reduction, along with their characteristics, will be covered in the final section.
