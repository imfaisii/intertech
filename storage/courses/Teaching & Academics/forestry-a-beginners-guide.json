Trees dominate the complex ecosystem known as ‘forest’, which is made up of many plants and animals. Apart from providing habitats and niches for different organisms and animals, forests also prevent soil erosion, serve as a means of livelihood, clean the air we breathe and more. Forestry focuses on how forests can be conserved, preserved and managed. But unfortunately humans may do several potentially harmful things that can ruin them. This course demonstrates the techniques of maintaining and managing forests, their classifications, types and characteristics.</p><p>Soil profiles vary depending on the forest type. Forests can impact the climate of a region or location and the organic matter found on the soil's surface, such as fallen leaves. We will analyse soil profiles, the five soil-forming factors and the four important types. We can measure forests regardless of the immense area and massive trees. You'll explore the concept of forest mensuration, the measurement and quantification of trees and its objectives. Discover the methods of measurement and the instruments used to measure them. Understand the concept of forest land survey, forest resource management and forest sampling.</p><p>A silviculture system is a planned series of treatments for tending, harvesting and re-establishing a stand. This course delves into silviculture classification and concepts. We'll examine the animals that occupy a forest and the processes of denitrification, volatilisation and ecological succession. Elegantly crafted furniture is admirable and comes from timber harvesting operations. Investigate the various timber logging methods and systems. Learn about urban forestry and its management needs. You don't require any skills or knowledge to take this course. We have designed it for those curious to learn more about forestry and its related facets.
