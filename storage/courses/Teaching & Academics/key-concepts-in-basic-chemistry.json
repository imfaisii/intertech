This course begins with the history of chemistry and how it relates to other scientific disciplines. The divisions of chemistry and how it is used in daily life is covered after that. Chemical reactions are responsible for many of the changes we see in the environment. Understanding the makeup of chemicals and their reactions can help us understand a range of physical and biological phenomena. Learn more about chemical bonding and equilibrium, including its traits, influences and related examples.</p><p>See how chemical elements are grouped in the periodic table according to their recurring properties and how the elements are arranged according to an electron configuration pattern. We will also teach you how to use the periodic table to identify the properties of all the elements, including those that haven't yet been discovered. The periodic table is a fantastic resource for problem-solving. We will also teach you about chemistry and electricity: learn how redox reactions and other electrical sources work to conduct electricity. Studying chemical reactions at the molecular level with biochemistry helps you comprehend the universe and create new applications for them. See how components of biochemistry have been used to create many initiatives for human welfare.</p><p>The term ‘nuclear’ has mainly been used in bad light because of nuclear weapons and reactor explosions, yet nuclear science has many benefits. Numerous diagnostic and therapeutic techniques employ nuclear medicine. You will learn more about nuclear chemistry in this course, including radioactive elements and how the medical field uses them. We will also look at environmental and industrial chemistry. To protect laboratory employees from injury caused by dangerous chemicals, you examine the lab safety and chemical hygiene strategy. Chemistry is important because it provides a solid foundation for comprehending the physical universe that we inhabit. This course's primary objective is to give you this knowledge and ensure that you are aware of how crucial chemistry is to our daily life. Anyone interested in learning the fundamentals of chemistry can enroll in this course; no prior expertise is necessary.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5253\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
