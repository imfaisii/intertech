Can you think of a food that isn't traceable to agriculture? Impossible, isn't it? Without agriculture, a country's economy is dead. Agriculture is the art, science and business of crop and livestock production for economic use. The development of agriculture is one of the major turning points in human evolution that helped in transitioning from nomadic lifestyles to settler and farming lifestyles. Food is the most basic human need. As populations grew, agricultural practices were refined, researched and experimented with various tools and resources to accommodate the greater needs for food. To maintain the production levels of food and meet the demands of the populations and economies, an understanding of the factors that shape the agricultural systems is necessary. In this course, we will help you develop your knowledge of the fundamental and applied science of agriculture along with its technological and business aspects.</p><p>Agricultural science has many branches. They deal with the technologies of soil cultivation and harvesting, animal production, the processing of plant and animal products for human consumption and more. We will teach you the basics of agricultural sciences and their application in seeds and crop management, gardening, ornamental horticulture and animal farming. We will show you how to grow and harvest fish in different climatic conditions and farm cattle for beef and dairy purposes. Discover the different uses of agricultural products including how to cut flowers and use them for aesthetic beauty, landscaping with ornamental plants as well as storing and using milk to produce different milk products. We will also introduce you to the philosophy behind permaculture that insists on the integration of land, resources, people and the environment through mutually beneficial synergies and how it is applied in urban and rural areas.</p><p>A career in agricultural science goes beyond being a farmer working in the field, riding a tractor or caring for farm animals. The agriculture industry plays a major role in contributing to the economy of a country. It includes agribusiness, research and development (R&amp;D) organisations, public and private agencies, government and policy-making agencies, private consulting companies and more. It also plays a vital role in the processing of food products and the productivity of crops and end products for consumers. Agricultural science professionals work towards improving the quality and quantity of farming, improving crop yield, minimising labour, conservation of soil and water and pest control. Whether you want to work in agronomy, soil science, biotechnology, farm enterprise management, agribusiness consulting, financial services, animal nutrition, animal welfare, or policy or simply improve the look of your garden, this course will help you gain or expand your knowledge. So why wait? take this course and prepare for a lasting and impactful career.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4640\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
