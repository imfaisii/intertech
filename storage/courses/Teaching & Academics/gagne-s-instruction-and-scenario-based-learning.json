It starts by introducing Gagne and the benefits of his model. These levels of the learning model provide a checklist to ensure that you present a comprehensive and successful learning experience. His approach motivates learners and helps them associate the topics covered in the course with what they already know. This model gives them a framework in which they can organise the content presented in the lesson and is used to gain their attention and inspire them. Designing motivating learning experiences is the challenge most instructional designers face. Everyone has different goals, desires and needs and finding a hook that will keep learners motivated is extremely difficult. Learn to create compelling lead-in introductions and combine internal and external motivators to stimulate their attention.</p><p>The following section is related to informing learners of objectives. During this phase, describe what learners should be able to do at the end of the course and the tools used to achieve them. Explore how to write objectives to create expectancy and describe the structure of the lecture. Discover the ‘SMART’ approach to ensure that your goals are well written. Bloom's Taxonomy is a valuable tool for creating learning objectives. Research various ways to include interactivity in your lessons and develop assessments that match your learning objectives. Your training activities should reflect the actual work they perform and provide exercises that allow them to apply their prior knowledge and experience to the theoretical aspects of the training. Relate the new lesson to familiar situations and past knowledge or experiences.</p><p>The following section explains the presentation of the content to describe the main points of the lesson. Discover how to provide guidance to your learners and elicit performance. To allow learners to practise and test their understanding of the material, try switching to scenario-based eLearning. We discuss the golden rules and explore eight highly effective eLearning scenario building blocks. It is crucial to provide reinforcement, remediation and confirmative, corrective, remedial, informative and analytical feedback to your learners. To determine whether they have mastered the objectives, include quizzes or other assignments in lessons.
