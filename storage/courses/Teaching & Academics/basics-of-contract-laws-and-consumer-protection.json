Consumers must have access to reliable, unbiased information about the items and services they buy. The government, businesses and consumers must collaborate to create an effective consumer protection system. We can do this by enforcing agreements called ‘contract laws’ that try to secure parties by implementing formalities. This course will help you gain a basic understanding of contract and consumer protection laws. First, we introduce you to UK laws and explain how they are drawn up. You'll learn about the structure, responsibilities and priorities of the Ministry of Justice, including the concepts of communicating, terminating, countering and accepting offers. We'll discuss in detail what to consider and the overall capacity of the parties involved.&nbsp;</p><p>The terms found within a contract are not all of the same importance. We will teach you how to analyse the different terminologies and their importance within a contract. Research concepts such as the limitations of various clauses such as liability, liquidated damages, confidentiality and the arbitration clause and the indemnity agreement. We'll explore what it means when a contract is ‘silent’. We'll investigate misinterpretations and outline the Misinterpretations Act of 1967 and the remedies for misunderstanding the terms of a contract. We also cover the various types of mistakes made between parties and how you can avoid them.&nbsp;</p><p>Consumer rights and protection laws provide a means whereby individuals can fight against abusive business practices or traders. The next section of the course focuses on consumer protection laws and the privity of contracts. The United Kingdom is very serious about protecting its consumers. Discover various employment contracts and conditions in the UK, including laws and regulations for international trade. This course is essential for law students, business owners and anyone working in the legal sector. When people and businesses can make and enforce agreements, they thrive. So why wait?
