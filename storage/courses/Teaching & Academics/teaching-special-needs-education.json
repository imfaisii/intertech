In this course, we will introduce you to the study of special educational needs. First, we will discuss how we define a student under the United Kingdom’s 2001 Code of Conduct for Special Education Needs (SEN). We will also learn how this relates to disability and its classification into four main areas. Next, we will discuss the support, assessment and the four-step cycle that helps meet the needs of these students. Are you wondering what SENCO is and how it can help us identify the needs of students with special needs? We will learn about SENCO and how to implement each cycle stage: assess, plan, implement and review.</p><p>The course will then explain what quality education is for students with SEN and how you can implement it in the classroom. We will explore different teaching methods and learn how to effectively implement instruction to create an inclusive classroom environment. Do you want to know what children and young adults with speech, language, and communication needs (SLCN) need? We will discuss instructional strategies to overcome SEN students' learning difficulties. In addition, we will address the challenges faced by students with moderate learning disabilities (MLD) and those with specific learning disabilities (SpLD). This course will also help us understand the issues faced by those with mental health issues and the principles of the ‘whole school’ strategy.</p><p>Want to learn in detail about students' significant physical and sensory needs? We will analyse how to deal with students who have visual, hearing or physical disabilities. We will examine some important strategies for supporting students with these impairments in the classroom. We will also investigate the importance of partnerships and why communication with parents, SENCO, and other professionals is vital for students with SEN. This course is ideal for anyone working in education for SEN students who want to improve their knowledge and skills. So why wait?
