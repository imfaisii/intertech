However, it is impossible to learn these skills without a solid foundation. Exposing children to these skills in their early life is essential to lay the foundation for writing and reading. This is crucial as young brains are open to learning and adapting these abilities. When teaching these skills, no other method is better than the Montessori method.</p><p>After enrolling, you will find that we have dedicated a significant portion of this course to Dr Maria Montessori's thoughts and observations on this matter. An important aspect is that it proceeds in the manner of ‘write-and-read’ instead of the conventional method of ‘read-and-write’. The authors of this course have implemented this strategy in light of Dr Montessori's ideals. As you proceed in this course, you will find discussions on the means through which children learn to read and write and the significance of understanding these mechanisms.</p><p>The course also contains different activities and strategies to introduce children to writing and reading skills. Various activities, such as tracing, drawing and using tactile letters, have been mentioned in this regard. Moreover, it also discusses reading sequence, reading comprehension and their components. Finally, the course also describes how you can build children's interest in reading at school and home. In this regard, each topic has been written in simple language and contains exciting infographics. You will also find challenging questions at the end of each topic to assess your progress.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5053\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
