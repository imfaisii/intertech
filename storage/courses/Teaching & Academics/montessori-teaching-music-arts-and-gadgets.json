People like Leonardo da Vinci, Mozart and Michelangelo have been pioneers in their fields. These individuals created masterpieces not only because of their immense interest and fondness for art, music and sculpture: their environments enriched their abilities, providing them with the needed stimuli.</p><p>If we want to cultivate more great artists today, we must provide children with the foundations to emulate them. They can design and erect buildings and dabble in the aesthetic arts, crafts and vibrant music. When building foundations in these cultural domains, no other approach is better than the Montessori method. This course is designed to help you learn about various activities through which you can help Montessori children develop strong foundations in these fields. We have divided the content of this course into four topics, each with its own focus and questions to help cement your understanding.</p><p>Apart from covering arts, crafts and music, the course also enables you to introduce Montessori children to digital devices without violating any rules of Montessori teaching. By taking this course, you will acquire practical strategies with which you can make the use of these devices and gadgets more meaningful and safe for children. Enrol today and become confident in helping children explore their creative interests and passions.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5090\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
