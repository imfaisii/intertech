Calculus is an integral part of science and technology. It needs to be understood from a basic level, then used for the correct derivation of complex theories in economics, environmental analysis, nuclear science, and engineering. To help you grasp calculus, the sub-branch of pre-calculus breaks down the building blocks of this important part of college math.</p><p>In this course, you will learn how to evaluate various mathematical functions, including exponential, polynomial, rational, logarithmic, and algebraic functions. Learners will evaluate these functions by understanding their definitions, workings, and sample problems. The workings of each step are explained in the solutions of sample problems. Your understanding will be tested with an assessment to ensure you fully grasp the methods used in pre-calculus.</p><p>The basics of algebra - such as imaginary and complex numbers, as well as rational expressions - are also covered. By the end, you should be comfortable with solving fundamental problems in pre-calculus. This is a College Level Examination Program (CLEP) course that is open to all.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
