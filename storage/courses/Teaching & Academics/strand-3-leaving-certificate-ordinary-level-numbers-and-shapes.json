And we cannot escape using numbers in our everyday lives, counting the minutes and hours of our day with our clocks, counting out cash to pay for items or services and much much more.</p><p>Applying arithmetic and geometric series in finance is examined through investments and loan repayments. Using AER (annual equivalent rate) and APR (annual percentage rate) when calculating your repayments is examined. Students then look at the concept of a complex number and are shown how to multiply, divide, add and subtract them.</p><p>Complex numbers can be used to represent the current flow in a circuit and they are widely seen in electronics generally. Numbers are used to measure the perimeter and area of many shapes (hexagons, rectangles, triangles, circles, trapeziums and parallelograms) and we also try to work out the volumes of solids such as cones, spheres, cylinders and hemispheres. Determining the area of various compound shapes is extremely vital for problems on the exam and in your real life, for instance, washing machines and buildings.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
