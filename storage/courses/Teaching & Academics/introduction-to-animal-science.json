Do you rear livestock for commercial purposes? Understanding their anatomy and physiology is vital to making the most out of raising them. It is no surprise that animals play a crucial role in modern civilisation since they provide us with food, clothing, companionship and even entertainment. So it is essential to keep these animals healthy and productive. This course focuses on the anatomy and physiology of common animals and the diseases they are susceptible to. First, we introduce you to the basic aspects of animal science and discuss in detail the importance of animals to humans. Gain insight into the trends in animal agriculture, the welfare of animals, animal rights and more. You will learn why animals who are treated well and not stressed are more efficient and powerful producers.</p><p>Physiology deals with the study of organs, bones and muscles of animals. Understanding physiology will help you understand what makes animals sick and how to help them become healthy. This course provides an overview of the anatomy and physiology of some prominent animal families, including birds, reptiles and rabbits. We will introduce you to the basic structure and functions of different parts of the cell, the basic building block of life. We'll then explore some of the various bacterial, fungal and viral diseases of common domesticated animals and their treatment and prevention. Have you ever wondered how differences in genes impact animal species' form and structural diversity? This course investigates how genes affect animal design and diversity and how they have evolved over time.&nbsp;</p><p>Animals use the nutrients obtained from foods for various purposes. In light of this, it is important to know how to keep animals healthy by giving them the proper nutrition in the correct quantity. In addition, understanding common diseases and their treatments are necessary to ensure a high-quality life for animals. We will research the nutrients required for animals to grow and maintain their anatomical and physiological compositions and some of the factors that influence the energy requirements of these animals. This course is vital for animal lovers, biology students, cattle farmers and generally anyone interested in knowing about the function of an animal body. Gaining knowledge about how the bodies of animals work and how to keep animals healthy is invaluable.
