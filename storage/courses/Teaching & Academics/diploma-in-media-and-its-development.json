We begin with the evolution of print media and its influence on the flow of information, starting with the invention of the printing press. We use the ideas of prominent theorist Harold Innis to explain the political ramifications of mass media and its role in defining public opinion. We go through the critical responses of various influential thinkers like Jean Baudrillard to help you understand the changing dimensions of culture as norms and technology changed together over the last century.</p><p>The course delves into the works of Marshall McLuhan, a giant in the field, as we go through his analysis of the effect of media technology on culture and society. We unpack the concepts of ‘hot’ and ‘cool’ media and McLuhan’s explanation of the formation of public opinion through postmodern media. We enter the world of radio, television, film and literature as we establish the effect of evolving technology, culminating in contemporary theories of New Media as we examine digital publishing and social media.</p><p>This course is a blend of arts, philosophy and science and thus provides you with an all-round view of media and its changing role in our public and private lives. We are bombarded with information in our media-saturated lives and this course broadens your understanding of that process. It can help you pursue a career in mass communication, journalism or media planning but will be of interest to anyone who wants to understand the shifting foundations of the Information Age.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/3050\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
