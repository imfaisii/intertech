We lay out the ecological benefits and value of forests that illustrate why it is so important to manage them and keep their environments safe.</p><p>The course discusses the various definitions of forests, including their technical and legal definitions. We identify the various classes of forests and the different creatures that inhabit them. We compare the biotic and abiotic components of woodlands to explain the objectives of forest management. The course then shows you how to calculate the total economic value of forests. In this section, we compare the 'use-value' and the 'non-use-value' of a forest and outline several methods used to evaluate woodlands.</p><p>Finally, we explore the history of silviculture (the study of forests). We study the factors that facilitate plant growth and address the subject of ‘ecological succession’, which explains the natural processes that lead to forest formation. This course will interest anyone studying forestry, wood production, climate change and any related field. We can also help those interested in ecology and the environment as forests play a key role in preserving our planet and its atmosphere.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/2358\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
