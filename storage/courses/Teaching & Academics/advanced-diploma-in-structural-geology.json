You will learn about the architecture of rock formations and their development over geological time periods, and how deformed rocks and structures conceal a series of tales.</p><p>It begins with structural elements, measurements and stereographic projections of linear and planer features. You will learn about the concepts of stress, strain and rheology of rocks. This course provides insights into the deformation mechanisms of rocks, folds, foliation and lineation, boudinage, faults and joints, ductile shear zone and much more. The course also examines how rocks deform and change shape and how we can recognise and use structures within rocks, to determine ancient magnitudes and the orientations of stress fields.</p><p>Students of this course will be introduced to the techniques of recording and analysing structural data. They will be taught how to map rock sequences in the field and interrogate a region, to determine how it formed and what has happened to the area since formation. This course will be of interest to students studying geology-related subjects, laypersons interested in the topic and for career-development purposes. Start this course today and learn more about structural geology and its applications.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/2241\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
