This comes from the common misunderstanding of algebraic basics. Enrol in this free online course to properly learn the fundamentals of algebra and how they relate to fields that compare quantities in both theory and practice. This is a College Level Examination Program course.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Learn how to solve basic algebra by following simple step-by-step methods through the use of operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Replace your textbooks with a better fundamental learning experience of algebra and its many applications in various industries like architecture, engineering, and even life sciences. You will understand the simpler ways of solving medium to advanced concepts related to pre-calculus. You will also get solutions to various sample problems through illustrations relating to real-life scenarios. Video walkthroughs help illustrate vital explanations for theories that are often considered difficult to understand. Numbers are the building blocks of algebra, which is often used to form elementary theories in business, finance, accounting, computing, and economics. These numbers are combined with variables to form different matrices used in studying the varying changes in product supply and demands in markets.&nbsp;</p><p>Understand the fundamentals of algebra, one step at a time. Combine important lessons evaluating different types of fractions, numbers, equations, and inequalities to enhance your knowledge of crucial algebraic basics. Learners need this CLEP course to improve their chances of studying and understanding advanced calculus in the future because aspects of pre-calculus like imaginary and complex numbers are integral to the solutions of quadratic equations with roots that barely touch the x-axis of the cartesian plane. Why risk it and struggle with more advanced calculus lessons when you can enrol in this course and become an expert in the basics of algebra on successful completion? Capacitors, inductors, and other electronic components require physicists to generally make use of complex numbers. This is a characteristic of basic algebra discussed in this course. It is also used for the easy representation of electrical impedance without which alternating current (AC) circuits cannot be properly analyzed.</p><p>Communication has always been an important part of human society. In mathematics, algebra molds the important communication method of relating various quantities, functions, and expressions through variables, numbers, and symbols. It also helps in the application of different mathematical operations. This pre-calculus course has been specially put together to take you through the building blocks of algebra in the easiest of ways. This covers various types of equations, inequalities, and common systems of equations. It is important for economics, physics, and mathematics students to take this course as it will help them understand the theories shaped by algebra in their respective fields.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
