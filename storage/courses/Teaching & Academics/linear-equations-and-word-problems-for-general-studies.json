You can express linear equations in many forms and it is also possible to plot their graphs. This course identifies all these concepts thoroughly in a progressive way. You will discover how to solve a word problem, a mathematical exercise where you present information on the problem in ordinary language.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>This course is the fourth in a series of algebra topics in Mathematics. It discusses some advanced processes of linear equations. We introduce you to linear equations and inequalities in two or more variables. A system of linear equations consists of two or more linear equations made up of two or more variables such that all equations in the system are considered simultaneously. To find the unique solution to a system of linear equations, find a numerical value for each variable in the system that will simultaneously satisfy all equations in the system. By the end of this course, you will be able to solve systems of equations by graphing, substitution and addition. You will also be able to identify inconsistent systems of equations containing two variables and express the solution of a system of dependent equations.</p><p>Graphing linear inequality can be confusing without the proper knowledge. We apply the same steps and concepts to graph a linear equation to graph linear inequalities. The only difference between the two equations is that a linear equation gives a line graph. In contrast, a linear inequality shows the area of the coordinate plane that satisfies the inequality. Investigate the different steps used when graphing a linear inequality and solving systems of linear inequalities graphically. As there are many equations, inequalities also exist in various forms and quadratic inequality is one. A quadratic inequality is an equation of second degree that uses an inequality sign instead of an equal sign. You will learn to solve quadratic inequalities and use number line analysis to find the solution set.</p><p>Lastly, the course introduces you to mathematical word problems. A word problem is a mathematical exercise where vital background information on a problem is presented in ordinary language rather than in mathematical notation. Word problems commonly include data and information about a particular system and a student is required to develop a model. For example, Jane had $5.00 and then spent $2.00. How much does she have now? These examples are intended to lead students to develop mathematical models independently and promote mathematical interest and understanding by analysing real-life situations. Word problems are a common way to train and test knowledge of underlying concepts using a descriptive problem instead of solely exercising algebraic manipulation or other mechanical skills. By the end of this course, you will be an expert in solving different word problems.
