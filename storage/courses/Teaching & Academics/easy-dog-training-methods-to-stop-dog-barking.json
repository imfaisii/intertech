We focus on empowering you, the dog owner, and provide the tools you need to get your dog’s attention and cooperation. This course uses step-by-step video demonstrations to teach you the ‘pack leader’ theory combined with positive reinforcement techniques.</p><p>We explain how to keep your dog quiet when someone comes to the front door and how to end any barking with a single command. The course covers techniques that convince your dog, in a kind way, that you are in charge. This means that their job is to alert you to potential danger, as the ‘pack leader’, instead of engaging in uncontrollable territorial behaviour. We examine the infamous phenomenon of the dog’s resentment towards visitors like the mail carrier to help you avoid domestic confrontations. We then delve into the crucial part you play: your reaction can either calm the situation or encourage more frenzied canine behaviour. This course teaches you how to send the right signals to your dog to leave them relaxed and confident in your leadership.&nbsp;</p><p>This course provides the dog-training knowledge and confidence you need to curb your dog’s barking and leave them feeling calm and happy. We also demonstrate how you can become your dog’s ‘pack leader’ without shouting or using violence. This means your dog barks to alert you to danger but stops straight away when you tell them to. This course can help you to have a dog that calmly walks past cats, says a friendly ‘hello’ to people and relaxes, and even goes to sleep, during car rides. Sign up if you would like to learn how to stop your dog barking with a simple command or if you care for dogs professionally.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4106\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
