You will learn how distance, speed, time, and mass are combined to give displacement, velocity, force, and acceleration. Motion, speed, and time are three fundamental concepts in basic physics and important building blocks for understanding more advanced topics. You will learn that Newton's Three Laws of Motion are the bedrock of much of our understanding of physics, and more!","courseOutcomes":["Differentiate between vector and sca...","Discuss Physics Notation...","Describe how vectors, such as veloci...","Calculate the unknown values from th...","Differentiate between vector and scalar values","Discuss Physics Notation","Describe how vectors, such as velocity and acceleration, are derived","Calculate the unknown values from the known values","Identify Newton's Three Laws of Motion","Differentiate between vector and sca...","Discuss Physics Notation...","Describe how vectors, such as veloci...","Calculate the unknown values from th...","Differentiate between vector and scalar values","Discuss Physics Notation","Describe how vectors, such as velocity and acceleration, are derived","Calculate the unknown values from the known values","Identify Newton's Three Laws of Motion"],"courseDescription":"<p>This course will first introduce you to the physics of motion, speed, and time. You will study scalars, which are quantities that are fully described by a magnitude or numerical value, while vectors are quantities that are fully described by both a magnitude and a direction. You will learn how to calculate average velocity or speed and how to solve for time. This course will also teach you how to derive displacement from time and velocity.</p><p>Acceleration is an object's change of velocity with respect to time. This course will discuss acceleration with respect to velocity. You will study Newton's Three Laws of Motion, which indicate that first, every object in a state of uniform motion will remain in that state of motion unless an external force acts on it. Second, force equals mass times acceleration, and third, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p><p>The study of physics can help you strengthen your quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills, which are highly valuable in several areas beyond physics. This course will teach you how things work from first principles to help you gain a clearer knowledge and understanding of important topics in basic physics. So, check out this course today, and start learning more about the world you live in, for free.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/1735\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
