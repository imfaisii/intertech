You will study chemistry symbols, atoms, molecules, elements, chemical bonds, and compounds. You will also cover ions and particles, and study the three states of matter: liquids, gases, and solids. You will look into mixtures, and discuss the two types of corrosive substances: acids and bases. In addition, this course will discuss PH scales, PH meters, and acid-base indicators.</p><p>Mixtures can be separated using different techniques. This course will discuss chromatography (which is used to separate mixtures of substances into their components), decanting (which is the separation of liquids from solids by gradual pouring), dissolving, solidification, and precipitation. You will also look into evaporation, distillation which purifies a liquid by heating or cooling, and filtration which separates solids from liquids using a medium. You will also study sublimation which is the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas phase.</p><p>Chemistry is also known as the central science because it joins together biology and medicine, physics and mathematics, and the earth and environmental sciences. By the end of this course, you will have gained a deeper understanding of the behavior of atoms, molecules, and ions, all of which determine the very world we live in. So, check out this course today and start gaining a clearer understanding of the fundamentals of chemistry, all for free.</p><p>Chemistry is also known as the central science because it joins together biology and medicine, physics and mathematics, and the earth and environmental sciences.
