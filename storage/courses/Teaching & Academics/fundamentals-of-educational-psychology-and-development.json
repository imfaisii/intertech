It provides critical information to educators that helps them measure learning, create educational experiences and improve student understanding. This course introduces you to educational psychology and how it can be used to improve learning experiences. First, we explain the difference between psychology and educational psychology, and look at the contributions of prominent figures in educational psychology over time. You explore how learning takes place, what influences it and the common behavioural learning theories. After that, we teach you the general principles of development, the different stages of cognitive development including the attainment of key social skills, and the processes of social and moral development in children. Constructivism is a useful approach to learning that states that both social interactions and learner participation greatly influence the attainment of knowledge. Explore how knowledge is ‘constructed’ and the applications of constructivism in the process of learning.</p><p>There are several specific learning difficulties and disorders that exist mainly due to neurological conditions. Learn about these in children and adults and how they impact their academic performance. Educational psychology plays an important role in the development of learning environments and the standards of teacher-student relationships. We’ll teach you about the key components required for elevating students’ motivation and ways to create a conducive learning environment. Explore an effective model of school learning, and the use of technology and the Internet in planning and presenting content. To practise as a regulated educational psychologist, there are certain accredited degrees you must possess. You will learn about the skills and responsibilities of an educational psychologist, as well as the qualification requirements.</p><p>This course is designed for people working in the field of education who want to improve their teaching experience.
