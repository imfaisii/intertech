This free online course begins by showing you how to sign up on the platform and create a new user account and profile. We outline the four available options for completing your registration as a new user and cover the best approach to creating a username that is relevant to your brand and business goals. We then demonstrate how to craft an alluring TikTok bio that showcases your mission, offerings and business philosophy to your target audience. The course then lays out the simple process for linking your YouTube and Instagram accounts to your TikTok. We also establish why you should select the ‘creator’ account option and not the alternative options when creating a new account.</p><p>The course then moves on to TikTok navigation to highlight how the app’s algorithm works. We break down how you can use content creation and posting strategies to tweak the program for increased brand engagements while you populate the ‘For You’ page (FYP). We study the platform’s internal artificial intelligence (AI) and conduct a frame-by-frame analysis of its capabilities to illustrate the importance of content in determining relevance. The course demonstrates the potency of the app as a marketing tool and outlines the metrics for the ‘monthly active user’ (MAU) base. We explore the benefits of selecting the right niche, the importance of consistency in posting content and why you should avoid deletion of your uploaded videos. We teach you the three-point agenda that must be fulfilled to create inspirational and effective content. We then show you how to use organized sounds and popular songs to make entertaining content that could go viral.</p><p>The course lays out how to find niche trends via TikTok’s analytic tools and apps, such as TrendTok, as we establish the importance of the process to your brand growth and organic reach strategies. Learn how to ‘snowball’ your engagements and enhance the capabilities of the app’s algorithm to promote your content in other users’ FYP and hashtags. We reveal the best time of the day to post content that guarantees optimum productivity and great results for each day of the week. The course examines the impact of such content analytics on your marketing success and explains the TikTok marketing and engagement tools, including the voice-over and caption functions. We demonstrate the use of other important features, including the app’s text-to-speech capabilities, playlist systems and ‘stitching’ and ‘duet’ options. We examine the ‘hook’, ‘value’ and ‘call to action’ (CTA) methods for creating effective video advertorials as well as the niche influencer marketing models that can widen your client base. This course can help you find your niche trends, grow your client base and boost your business revenue through TikTok marketing.
