The course begins with lessons on business-to-business (B2B) markets. You will be introduced to and learn about some of the characteristics of a business-to-business market and the differences between B2B and B2C market types. You will learn also about the demand for products in a B2B market. After being introduced to the B2B market type, you will then learn more about the B2B buyers and their behaviours. Customers in B2B markets are often categorized into four; resellers, producers, Institutions, government. Learn about these four categories of B2B customers and their respective examples with this free online course. Every purchase goes through a common cycle for buyers. You will learn about these stages in the buying process for B2B markets. Why do you think companies want to be near their buyers? There are a couple of reasons why companies want this, and this course will carefully point out some of these reasons. You will also learn about the concept of disintermediation in business transactions and its application in different business settings.</p><p>Furthermore, this course provides lessons on using marketing channels. You will be introduced to marketing channels and learn about what channel partners represent as well as their functions. You will learn about supply chain management and how it relates to marketing channels.&nbsp; Afterwards, You will learn about the types of channel partners and how they are best categorized. Businesses often run multiple channels of marketing. Find out why and how using multiple and alternate channels have become a practice with some top firms. Oftentimes, there is a conflict of marketing channels in businesses, and this conflict is solved mostly by getting the channels to cooperate. But how is this channel cooperation achieved, you may ask? This course will provide lessons on how to ethically achieve channel cooperation and integration to avoid or curb conflict. Consumer purchasing behaviour is another key area in marketing and one where proper attention must be paid. Do you think personality traits, or something as random as a storeâ€™s design, can influence purchasing behaviour? Find the answer to this question and more with this free online course as you learn about the societal, psychological, situational and personal factors that can influence purchasing behaviour.</p><p>Marketing is all about the customer. But who is the customer? If you are a car manufacturer, you have multiple types of customers. You might have governments and rental agencies that wish to buy fleet vehicles. We call these customers business-to-business (B2B). You would also have dealerships to whom you want to sell your cars; this is also B2B. Then, there are the end-users or dealer's customers. Though the dealer owns the car when it is sold, the manufacturer almost always plays a crucial role in the marketing of that car. Identifying your target customer can be difficult, but with the proper definitions and the right research, marketers will know their customers better than they know themselves. These are just about some of the things this course hopes to help you learn as a marketer. You will be provided with thorough lessons on the buying behaviours of businesses in B2B, the processes and dynamics of using marketing channels, and the buying behaviours of consumers. It is an opportunity for marketers and marketing enthusiasts to learn a great deal about marketing channels and buying behaviours.
