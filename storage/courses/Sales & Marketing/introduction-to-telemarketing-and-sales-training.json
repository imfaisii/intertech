Whether they possess the ‘power of persuasion’, the ‘capacity to convince’ or the ‘wit to win over’, dynamite salespeople are not born with the traits required to succeed. They possess the commitment, discipline and drive to learn the best ways to build relationships with their prospective customers. Telemarketing is very different to face-to-face sales and making sales pitches over the phone demands different skills so this sales training course provides the specific proven techniques your team needs to get more customers to buy your products and services.</p><p>We discuss the top strategies used by telemarketing and telesales professionals to get commitments from potential customers. Our first topic examines the definition, process, types and benefits of telemarketing. We then explain how to increase sales made over the phone by gearing up for winning calls, overcoming sales aversion and making the most of your time.</p><p>The course identifies the four probabilities of success that can help you achieve measurable business results. We highlight the top ten words and phrases to use during sales-related interactions. Most prospects will judge your intelligence, professionalism and knowledge in the first seven seconds so we show you how to include six key components in your seven-second opening statement and how to deal with objections and rejections. Sign up for this telemarketing and telesales training course to pick up key skills that you can use to close deals over the phone.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
