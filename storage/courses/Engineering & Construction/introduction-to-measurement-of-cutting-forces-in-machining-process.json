Stresses give an idea about the relative intensity of the force. Force divided by area is the stress. Sometimes the force may be very high. Stresses are needed for designing. Next we will discuss machining of brittle materials. Single shear plane models and Merchantâ€™s analysis are not suitable for the machining of brittle materials.</p><p>Next we will discuss other models of finding out the cutting forces in orthogonal machining. Mechanics of metal cutting consists of study of the machining process and accurate estimation of dynamic cutting forces by the use of suitable analytical models. Different scientists have prepared different models and advanced their own theory and analysis of metal cutting action. There are certain basic concepts used by most of them.</p><p>In this course, we will discuss the mechanics of oblique cutting. The mechanics of oblique cutting, including the parasitic forces near the cutting edge, are described. These mechanics make it possible to determine the parasitic forces from measurements of the cutting forces, the cutting ratio and the chip flow angle. Finally we will talk about how we can measure the cutting forces. Measurement of cutting forces during certain cutting conditions is useful for rational and economic design of machine tools.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
