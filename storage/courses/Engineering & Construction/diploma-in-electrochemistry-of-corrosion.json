This course will introduce you to the electrochemical nature of corrosion, as well as aspects that show the thermodynamics of the corrosive process. The relationship between free energy and the equilibrium constant, as well as how the Nernst equation can be derived for a reaction, will also be covered by the material.</p><p>You will study the various limitations of standard reduction potential series, as well as how a Pourbaix diagram is constructed. Learn about the positions where the acidic and basic reactions will happen, as well as the schematic phase diagram for aluminium (AI). This course will teach you about the steps used in the estimation of corrosion rate, as well as kinetics or rate of corrosion for a metal.</p><p>Furthermore, you will get familiar with electrode double layers, as well as the different types of polarization and the correlation between current density and overvoltage. You will also master the steps in deriving the mixed potential theory. Understanding corrosion is an essential part of electrochemistry and this diploma course will give you a solid grounding in the types, causes and processes of corrosion.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
