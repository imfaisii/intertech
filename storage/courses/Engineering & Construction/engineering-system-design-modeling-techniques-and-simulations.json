Modeling and Simulation involves a process of designing a model of a real-world or anticipated system such as a design concept, then conducting experiments with the model for the purposes of understanding the performance of the system under different operating conditions and evaluating alternative management strategies and decision-making processes. In System Engineering, modeling and simulation techniques are applied to two distinct types of system; physical mechanisms whose performance is governed by the laws of physics and process-based systems whose performance are governed by human, group and organizational behaviors.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, you will learn about different Modeling Techniques and Decision making in System Designs. You will learn how to use a model to study the behavior and performance of an actual or theoretical system. It will allow you to develop a feel for what variables are important in this phase of system design.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Course is suitable for learners who are considering working in Engineering or System Design. If you're a professional seeking to learn about Modeling and Simulations, then this clear and simple course is for you. Understanding the different Modeling and Simulation Techniques is of vital importance for professionals working in this industry.
