Trigonometry is the study of triangles and the principles are fundamental in electrical engineering because it is used to create circuits and describe the sinusoidal movement and characteristics of current and voltages in circuits. This electrical engineering course begins by introducing you to triangles and their theorems. You will learn about different types of triangles, intersecting lines and parallel lines. Thereafter, you will discover how to differentiate between congruent and similar triangles as well as supplementary and complementary angles. Moving on from there, you will be taught how to prove the Pythagorean theorem and how to use it to find the missing sides of a triangle. This online electrical course explores the unique angles and their expression as both a function and simple ratios as well as trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent.</p><p>Electrical parameters and values are better understood using the concept of the unit circle, angles, sine, cosine and tangent values and you will be taught how to express the sine, cosine and tangents of special angles in simple ratios. Through the concept of the unit circle, you will then gain an understanding of why the trigonometric functions have a negative sign for some angles. Since there are many special angles, remembering them can be a great challenge. Have you ever wondered if there is a simple way to easily remember the values of these special angles? Well yes, there is! This certificate in electrical engineering provides you with a trigonometric table that would help you easily remember the values of special angles and trigonometric functions without having to use a calculator. The laws of sine and cosine will also be taught in order to calculate the missing sides or unknown sides of a triangle as well as missing angles.</p><p>As an electrical engineer, you are at one point in your career going to run into proofs of trigonometric equations. This electrical engineering online course is going to teach you how to prove basic trigonometric identities such as the sum formula, difference formula, product to sum and sum to product formulas. You will also learn about the reciprocal identities, quotient identities, negative angle identities and Pythagorean identities. The content also covers how to prove the double-angle and half-angle formulas and how to apply them to solve trigonometric problems and then concluding with how to use trigonometric tables to find the sine, cosine and tangent of angles between 0 and 90 degrees. Basic knowledge of intermediate mathematics such as equations and binomials is required to gain the most value out of this interesting course. You should enrol for this course if you are an electrical engineer, technologist or student of engineering and technology because the fundamental knowledge of trigonometry is widely applied in these and related fields and can open a new set of potential job opportunities.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
