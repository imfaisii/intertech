Many experiments, trials and tests are carried out in this regard. At the core of this research process is the little-known discipline of biointerface engineering. In this course, you learn about this fascinating subject and its role in improving human lives. Firstly, study the fundamentals of intermolecular forces, the four forces of nature and the classification of these energies and pair potentials. After that, you will learn about the basics of thermodynamics, the strength of interactions and the hydrophobic effect. These form a solid foundation for the subsequent lessons, and they influence the natural environment. Have you ever wondered how spiders and other organisms can walk on water? You will get to understand how that happens as you learn about surface energy, surface tension, and surfacesâ€™ wettability characteristics. These are closely related to adhesion, cohesion, and interfacial energy thermodynamics, which will be explained in detail.</p><p>Next, you will discover the various ways of measuring surface tension in liquids and solids. Then, study the solid-liquid interface and the techniques used to measure the contact angles formed when a drop of a liquid comes into contact with a solid surface. In addition, find out how to determine the contact angle of a finely divided powder and learn about the two types of contact angles. This will prepare you for the next module on protein-surface interactions. Proteins are commonly known as the building blocks of life, and this section takes you through their components and role in the human body. Then, the factors that affect protein stability are elaborated on, followed by the methods to measure adsorbed proteins, and their advantages and disadvantages. Lastly, you are taken through the kinetics of protein adsorption, where you study the step-by-step procedure of the process. The phenomenon of intramolecular rearrangements will be presented before the final aspect of competitive adsorption, and the Vroman effect is explained.</p><p>Knowledge in biointerface engineering plays a pivotal role in medical research, diagnostics and development of new medicines and vaccines. If you are a medical practitioner, biomedical researcher, or clinician, you will find this course fascinating, and you will easily relate to the concepts and ideas presented as you enrich and refresh your knowledge. This course will also be helpful to nurses, pharmacists, medical officers, and clinical officers who would like to expand their knowledge of medical research. If you are a medical student or are aspiring to join one of these professions in the future, this course forms a firm foundation for your career, and you will find it exciting and fulfilling. The demand for solutions to emerging public health problems is ever-growing, especially with the proliferation of new infectious illnesses putting millions of lives at risk worldwide. Therefore, taking this course is imperative to joining the medical research and pharmacological fraternity to help save humanity.
