This course teaches you about nitrogen, its reaction with hydrogen to produce ammonia, and the effects of its compounds on the environment. Then, we explore sulfur's physical properties and the production of sulfuric acid. The transition elements, their properties, redox reactions, and stereoisomerism of their complexes are also discussed.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>The most prevalent element in group 15 of the periodic table, nitrogen, is the first element covered in this intermediate chemistry course. You learn about the nitrogen component, nitrogen gas, and its properties, as well as how ammonia is made in industry using the Haber-Bosch method and in the laboratory from ammonium chloride and magnesium nitride. You then discover the applications of ammonia and related compounds, including the creation of TNT explosives and fertilizers. Then we look into sulfur's physical properties, the contact method used to make sulfuric acid, and its industrial uses.</p><p>Next, the course moves on to transition elements, which occupy groups between two and 13 on the periodic table (starting from period 4) and are used in many aspects of life and industry. Some examples of transition elements are iron, copper and titanium. You study their electronic configurations and properties, like high melting points, densities and hardness. We also investigate the redox reactions of iron compounds and the titration process, as well as the formation of coordination bonds and aqueous complexes that result from the dissolving of salts of transition elements in water.</p><p>As the course progresses, we discuss the stereoisomerism of transition element complexes including geometrical isomers like cis and trans-platin and optical isomers that can rotate the plane of polarised light. You learn to determine whether a complex has geometrical and optical isomers (non-superimposable isomers). Finally, we explore the substitution of ligands with hydroxyl ions, ammonia, or halogen ions to form new complexes, more stable than aqueous ones, with different structures and colors. The final topic covered is the colors of period four transition element complexes and how they arise from the split of 3D orbitals into non-degenerate orbitals. Why wait?
