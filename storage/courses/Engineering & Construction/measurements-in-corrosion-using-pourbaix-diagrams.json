The course will also introduce you to the process for identifying where acidic and basic reactions will happen during the corrosion process. The schematic phase diagram for aluminium (Al) will also be covered.</p><p>This material then explains the steps used in the estimation of how quickly corrosion will occur, as well as the concept of ‘kinetics’ or the rate of corrosion. You will learn about the importance of determining the rate of dissolution of metal for any given reaction, as well as how it is measured. This course will teach you about the steps for calculating the corrosion rate in the form of mass loss per area per unit time.</p><p>Furthermore, you will get familiar with the steps for analysing the Pourbaix diagram for a corrosion reaction. See the different stability phases for a given corrosion reaction, as well as how these phases are relevant.
