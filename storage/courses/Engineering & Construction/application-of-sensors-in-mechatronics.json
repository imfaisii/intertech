They have proximity and other sensors that help automate cleaning and prevent them from hitting obstacles. Do you think the vacuum cleaner would control itself and perform the vacuuming efficiently without sensors? Mechatronic systems require sensors to measure and monitor various parameters to perform their function efficiently. It is essential that anyone who wants to be skilled in mechatronic systems gains knowledge of the working principles of these sensors. This course enlightens you on the working principles and application of the main sensors used in mechatronics. Before getting into the various sensors, you will learn about the different terminologies used in defining their performance. In addition, you will study the differences between sensors and transducers.</p><p>An engineer must consider certain factors to select suitable sensors for a project. This course explains the factors to assess when choosing sensors. It introduces you to the various sensors for measuring displacement, position, and proximity. First, you will be shown the working principles of potentiometers and strain gauges and their applications in mechatronic systems. Study how capacitive elements and linear variable differential transformers measure displacements. In addition, learn how encoders measure both linear and angular displacements. The course also explains how capacitive proximity and pneumatic sensors operate and how varieties of switches can act as sensors. Study the working principles of Hall effect sensors and tachogenerators and their importance in mechatronic systems. Next, see how piezoelectric sensors and tactile sensors are used to measure pressure. You will also examine sensors used in measuring fluid flow. The material discusses acceleration and vibration measurement. You will discover how to analyse the frequency response of an accelerometer, including the differences between accelerometers and vibrometers. The course concludes by explaining how microelectromechanical devices work.</p><p>To be a sought-after mechatronics engineer, you must understand how various sensors work. Without sensors, mechatronic systems wouldn't be as autonomous as they are today. When you recognise how sensors work, you will implement them properly in your project. Sensors can replace human controls and allow mechatronic systems to perform their functions independently. For example, with autonomous washers, you wouldn't need to keep checking the washing machine to see whether the clothes are clean. With autonomous vehicles, you wouldn't need to drive cars yourself. Sensors that have been properly put in place help do the job for you. This course is designed to show you how various sensors can make your designs efficient and autonomous. Begin this course today and gain the knowledge needed to develop systems that control themselves.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/3610\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
