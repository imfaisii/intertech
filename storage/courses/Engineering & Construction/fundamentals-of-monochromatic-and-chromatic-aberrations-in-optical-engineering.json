You will learn about the meaning of an aberration, the concept of paraxial approximation, the function of the numerical aperture along with what happens when the aperture size decreases in an optical system.&nbsp;</p><p>This optical engineering course then introduces you to the concept of astigmatism as another aspect of monochromatic aberrations and also how it occurs in optical systems. Spherical aberrations using the optics software for layout and optimization (OSLO), how to identify longitudinal aberrations as well as the function of ray intercept curves (or ray-lens intercept curves) in optical systems are then covered. The course content will introduce you to longitudinal chromatic aberrations as it relates to lenses and wavelength in optical systems, the different ways chromatic aberrations can be corrected, then finally working through how to make changes to a system after the aberration has been calculated without affecting the focal length of the system.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are keen on learning about the vast science of optical aberrations in more depth, then register today for this free online course in the Fundamentals of Monochromatic and Chromatic Aberrations in Optical Engineering.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
