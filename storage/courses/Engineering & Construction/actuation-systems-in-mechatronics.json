One way to do so is via actuators. This course on actuation systems will expose you to the various electrical and mechanical actuators used in mechatronics. You will learn their working principles and applications in mechatronic systems. In addition, you will examine various data representation systems.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Have you ever seen robots or robotic-type systems move some part of their body and wondered about the mechanism that allows them to make such movements? Actuators are responsible for such controlled action in a system. They work based on the signal they get from microprocessors. One such actuator is a motor. The motor is one of the major actuators used in mechatronics as it helps convert electrical signals to mechanical movements. However, motors are just one of the many actuators used in mechatronic systems. This course shows you how to use vital actuators in mechatronics. You will learn about actuation mechanisms and their applications. Discover how to design actuation mechanisms and the various instruments used in actuation. The course explains how cam and gear mechanisms operate as well as their implementation in mechatronic systems. The importance of bearings in mechatronics and mechanical factors to consider when selecting a motor for your mechatronics project are outlined.&nbsp;</p><p>Recognise the differences between hydraulic and pneumatic actuators, including their components and how they operate. You will learn about various types of valves, their symbols, and how to implement them in mechatronic systems. The course explains how relays and solenoids operate, as well as their applications in control systems. You will also be shown the basic principles of electric motors. Motors come in different designs thus their fundamental principles could vary. First, you will learn about the working principles of basic DC (direct current) motors, including the ones running on field coils or permanent magnets. In addition, the course explains how to control DC motors in a mechatronic system. Master the working principles of induction motors and synchronous motors, and learn the key principles of different types of stepper motors and their individual importance in mechatronics. Finally, examine the various data representation systems used in mechatronic systems.</p><p>Actuation systems are a vital part of mechatronic systems. Without them, no system would be able to perform mechanical movements. For example, robotic surgery wouldn't exist without actuation systems. If you donâ€™t put actuation systems in place, the robot wouldn't be able to move its arms to perform surgical operations. The same goes for using robotic systems in manufacturing companies. It is essential for anyone looking to become a specialist in mechatronics to understand how actuation systems work so you can select the suitable actuator for your mechatronics designs correctly. For example, if you are designing a mechatronic system that should move objects at precise angular increments, what type of motor would you go for? Selecting when you only understand the working operation of the various motors out there will help eliminate errors. Taking this course on actuation systems will help you with this task.
