You will work through the present applications of gas turbines (or GT technology) in the marine industry, as well as the differences between steam and gas engines. Learn about the advantages and disadvantages of a gas turbine, as well as the current trends in marine engine applications. This course will teach you about three main gas laws and principles - which include Bernoulli’s principle, Boyle’s law, and Charles’s law - as well as the different stages of the convergent-divergent process. The Brayton cycle - as well as other cycles used for operations like intercooling, intercooling recuperated, reheating, intercooling reheating cycle and the combined cycle - will also be explained. The material will ground you to the different types of gas turbine configurations such as single-shaft, split-shaft and twin-spool engines.</p><p>This course then explains the constructional features of a gas turbine, as well as the three main sections comprising the compressor, combustor and turbine itself. You will also learn about the functions, working principles and components of the axial flow and centrifugal compressors. Then, study the two types of axial compressors (drum-type and disk-type compressor rotor) as well as the elements of an axial flow compressor (the rotor and stator). You will analyze the functions and working principles of the combustion chamber, as well as its three main types, which include can, annular and can-annular. This course will teach you about the various functions of the accessory drive section of a gas turbine, as well as the ball and roller bearings. The functions, working systems, and pros and cons of three types of oil seals - lip-type, labyrinth, and carbon ring - will also be covered by the material.</p><p>Furthermore, this free course will help you get familiar with starting system procedures and precautions for gas turbines, as well as developments in the electric start system. You will tackle the features, functions and operations of pneumatic starters, as well as the disadvantages of hydraulic starting systems. The dry-sump and wet-sump lubrication systems will also be analyzed. Master the functions and types of epicyclic gears like star, planetary and solar gears. You will also be familiarized with the advantages of using multiple-planet wheels, as well as the functions and types of clutches, including twin-disk, airflex, hydraulic, sprag and SSS clutch. The purpose of the bleed air system, as well as the functions of the intake and exhaust system, will be explained. Then learn about the functions, components and data processing system of the automated central operating systems (ACOS). The course will benefit marine engineering students and those wanting more in-depth technical knowledge of gas turbines with the marine environment.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
