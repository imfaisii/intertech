Firstly, the course looks at the significance of travel demand management (TDM) in minimizing the problem of traffic congestion in urban areas. Next, the various TDM measures for attracting travellers to sustainable modes of transport and the significance of good parking management strategies to maximize the advantages of on-street and off-street parking facilities are discussed. Following from this, the factors that drive the trend towards transit-oriented development (TOD) and the various guiding and supporting principles of TOD are explained while the interdisciplinary and state-of-the-art advances in transportation systems are highlighted. This includes various methods of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) data collection and the process of achieving sustainable transportation through these systems. In addition, the role of remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) alongside ITS for interagency co-operation and visualization for informed decision making are also explained. The classification of ITS based on the positioning of the system is discussed.</p><p>Next, the course explains the role of traffic management centres and the various components of ITS. The different types of vehicular communications and the use of ‘big data’ in understanding the activity locations are highlighted, while basic ideas about the architecture of ITS are explained. This includes the different structural elements and the various service packages of ITS that are deployed in Indian cities specifically. Further, the architecture of electronic toll collection and the process of determining the delay and congestion in toll plazas based on the queuing theory are explained. You will then discuss the process of integrating ITS with a public bicycle-sharing system (or public bike share - PBS) to provide easy access for users. This includes the significance of the PBS model in facilitating the sustainable development of transportation in urban areas. Next, the overall planning process of an urban multimodal transport system and the process of assessing its impact on public transportation are explained.</p><p>Finally, the principles to be followed when designing a multimodal facility that integrates the different modes of transportation and the elements that are associated with pedestrian safety and security are examined. The types of crash estimation methods and the parameters of crash predictive methods are also laid out, including the significance of calibrating the crash models to local conditions to account for different types of crash frequencies. The relationship between transportation, estimating vehicular emissions and the need for experimenting with innovative ideas that can lead to sustainable transport development are analyzed. Lastly, the significance of impact assessments of all the transportation systems and the need for promoting sustainable approaches is highlighted. On completion of this course, you will be able to understand the process of implementing sustainable strategies in the transportation sector to make it environmentally viable. Doing a Diploma in Urban Transportation and Sustainability will interest students studying civil engineering, transportation engineering and urban planning or those who have an interest in these topics and sustainability.
