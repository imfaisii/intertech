We identify the components of cement and demonstrate how to determine its fineness, setting time, strength and soundness. Sign up to learn the techniques for testing fresh and hard concrete, including the slump cone, Kelly Ball and flow table tests.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Concrete is a crucial material used in construction and its main ingredients are cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate and water. This course establishes the benefits of concrete that drive its widespread use in the construction industry. We outline the impact of poor concrete to explain why you need to test it before starting construction. This course goes through the various stages of the methods used to manufacture and test concrete.</p><p>It is important that you learn how to classify concrete based on its binding materials, design and purpose. We examine the classification of aggregates based on their size, weight, nature of formation and shapes and provide different methods to test them, including the Elongation and Flakiness Index tests. We compare concreteâ€™s compressive and tensile strength and explain how to use specific tools to perform non-destructive tests of hardened concrete.</p><p>Finally, the course outlines how to ensure high-quality materials for building structures. It enhances knowledge and ability to test concrete and make the right decisions regarding construction materials. Using durable concrete that withstands all weather conditions will build your reputation with clients as an engineer.
