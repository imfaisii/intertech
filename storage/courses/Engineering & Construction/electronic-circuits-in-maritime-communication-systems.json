Maritime communication systems range from popular technologies such as autopilot and or self-steering systems, GPS, fuel monitoring and management and marine VHF radio, among many others. This course on electronic circuits in maritime communication systems teaches you valuable concepts related to marine communication systems, including the integral roles the electronic logic family plays in the principles and applications of all electronic circuits used onboard ships and vessels. We illustrate these complex elements of electronic circuits to assist you with understanding the application of multiplexers and demultiplexers. We also discuss the rules around combinational circuits and logic gates. This phenomenon of regulating electrons has led to some of the most significant innovations in the last century, including computers, televisions, electric cars, video games, smartphones and so on. This science is also essential for developing industries such as telecommunications, banking, logistics and shipping. Electronics has helped relevant players in maritime, like marine engineers, and perform various activities related to designing, constructing, testing and maintaining marine vessels. Electronics also drive the maintenance of offshore platforms for the docking of marine vessels.&nbsp;</p><p>The science of electricity is governed by many important elements covered in this course, including circuit types and the features that make them up. On the other hand, electronics technology is a function of many developments in maritime operations helping vessel and crew safety while encouraging naval efficiency. Circuits, a crucial component of energy transmission required by marine electronic communication systems, are also analysed. The course provides a basic understanding of maritime communication systems and covers digital electronic circuit elements, including logic gates, algorithmic state machines, shift registers, etc. Adders, subtractors, encoders, decoders and ROM are also addressed as combinational circuits. Discover relevant aspects of maritime communication systems such as modulation and demodulation and the classification of radars and their applications. Identify different communication systems and distinguish each one based on their workings and uses. The different types of latches and flip-flops are also well explained. Concepts related to other communication systems we have ashore, including AM and FM signal transmission, are dealt with in detail.</p><p>This course aims to equip you with an outlook of electronics consisting of different types of circuits relevant to maritime communication systems. These circuits involve fundamental mode sequential circuits applied by mariners and people connected to marine life. This course introduces you to digital circuits in marine electronics and the basic principles of how they work. Investigate different electric circuits, observing how various factors affect them, especially with aspects of communication. As the world expands and products need to be distributed to all corners of the earth, maritime transport systems are in dire need. The knowledge of electronic circuits in naval communication systems is thus becoming more and more relevant. This course will be of significant interest to students, researchers, marine engineers and anyone seeking to learn about marine electronics and its different workings.
