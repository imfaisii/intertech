But how does a vessel manage such a feat? In this course, you will study the features of a ship's architecture that allows it to stay upright, such as the principles of hydrostatics pressure and flotation, as well as the forces during towing while in a horizontal plane or a vertical plane. You will learn about transverse stability, centre of gravity and the centre of gravity of a ship. This course will also teach you about the shifts in the centre of gravity that occur aboard such a vessel. The course will cover transverse statical stability, the angle of the heel due to shifting a mass and the principles of stability. But what factors can impair the stability of a vessel? You will cover such obstacles as you also learn about the process of assigning load lines to tugs, watertight integrity and high water alarms.</p><p>As you continue through this course you will determine the importance of watertight openings found across a ship, like in the hull, superstructures or deckhouses. You will learn about the maintenance of watertight integrity, watertight bulkhead and water tightness tests. The standard operating procedure on board will also be discussed. You will then learn about how the floating tugboat's stability can be influenced by its displacement. The stability of a tugboat, the risk of capsizing, the concept of girting and the remedy to down flooding will be covered in this section. You will learn about a specific area of loss of intact stability-related casualties for tugboats and the characteristics of stability casualties. The course will also cover the towline emergency quick-release mechanisms. The heeling and righting arm curves, as well as additional stability criteria for service notation of escort tug, will be covered in the course.</p><p><br>Furthermore, this course will help you appreciate how important it is for the intact stability of tugs to comply with the International Code on Intact Stability 2008. You will also learn how to ensure all watertight decks and bulkheads are inspected periodically. The course will explain how to verify that there are no unprotected openings or improper penetrations that will allow progressive flooding. You will also learn about how the watertight subdivisions can be kept to a minimum and compatible with the design and proper working of the ship. The course will illustrate how the access doors and access hatch covers are to be closed at sea. The characteristics of watertight doors, non-watertight doors, spray-tight doors and panel doors will also be covered in this course. You will learn about closure fitting, gaskets, hope bay as well as the illustration of the covers for openings into holds and deck and scuttles. This free online course will be of great interest to students, researchers and anyone with an interest in the principles of vessel stability.
