These purposes may include but are not limited to the transition of electric power over long distances and the reduction of voltages of conventional power circuits to operate low voltage devices such as videocassette recorders (VCRs) and smartphones. This basic electrical course focuses on the three-phase power transformers and will teach you all you need to know about them. The course starts out with a review of electromagnetism and how they relate to transformers. You will learn the terminologies of transformers such as electromagnetic induction, magnetic hysteresis and much more. This online electrical course will help you gain an understanding of the power flow and turns ratio of ideal transformers as well as why real transformers donâ€™t function like ideal transformers. The content also explains extensively about the losses incurred by a real transformer and how they can be minimized, and all about instrument transformers, their types and uses.</p><p>Three-phase power is the ideal form of power transmission distribution. The three-phase transformer is therefore the best type of transformer for electrical systems that require high capacity distribution and high power capacity transmission. This certificate in electrical engineering will help you understand the advantages of three-phase power transformers over that of single phases. Thereafter, you will be shown the different types of connections of a three-phase transformer such as the star-star, star-delta, and delta-delta. The primary and secondary voltage of each connection type as well as their turns ratio is discussed before moving on to the vector nomenclature of transformer clock systems and how transformers are designed and constructed. Practical 2D and 3D animations are used to illustrate the construction and design of transformers so that you can grasp it easily.&nbsp;</p><p>All transformers incur losses as no transformer is truly an ideal transformer and most of the losses incurred by transformers are converted to heat. If this heat is not dissipated properly, the temperature of the transformer will rise continually which may cause damage to the insulation inside the transformer. It is therefore essential to control the temperature to ensure that the transformer lasts long by reducing the thermal degradation of its insulating system. In this electrical training course, you will learn about cooling systems such as the Air Natural (AN), Oil Natural Air Natural (ONAN) and Oil Natural Air Forced (ONAF) systems which are used to regulate the temperature of transformers. This course goes on to explore the transformer voltage classifications. Over time, as transformers are being used, they may develop faults, so there is the need to protect transformers and limit the damage. Your learning includes a good understanding of the basic transformer protection schemes and transformer relays that provide primary protection and control of transformers. You should enrol for this exciting, informative course if you want to learn the electrical fundamentals of transformers whether you are an engineer working in the electrical power industry and want to take your career to the next level or a student of engineering looking to refine your knowledge. Interactive 3D models are used extensively throughout the course to enhance learning and show you exactly how three-phase transformers work.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
