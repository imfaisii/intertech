Technologists require a good understanding of the different elements outlined in the course. It examines the laws that justify the behaviour of an electrically energized circuit along with AC circuits and power factors. The course begins with a discussion of Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, and the Wheatstone bridge technique. These laws form the basis for the unique behaviour of electricity and its component materials. You will learn about the distinct behaviours expected from circuits with voltage sources and varying loads. You will also learn about the effects of varying voltage levels and load intensities connected in parallel as well as in series. It is expected that learners would be able to apply the laws and theories they learn to the connection of electric circuits upon completion of required modules.</p><p>Over the years, several laws were extensively developed based on the concepts that will be uncovered to you. These laws form the basis for the technology we use in our homes and offices. Such technologies include computer printers, electric toothbrushes, and light lamps on the streets. Next, you will study the phasor relationship between voltage and current and the impedance of the AC circuit. This will involve phasor diagrams and impedance diagrams of RL series, RC series, and RLC series circuits. Then, you will analyze parallel circuits where the elements are connected in parallel across a voltage source. This will also include the phasor diagrams and impedance diagrams of RL, RC, and RLC parallel circuits. You will also learn about power, energy, and power factor improvement methods. Furthermore, you will analyze the classification of three-phase systems, and how to identify the phases and neutral of a 3-phase AC system. What are you waiting for? Improve your knowledge on the application of phase AC circuits.</p><p>This free online course will enable you to improve upon your foundational knowledge of electrical technology by analyzing electricity laws and phasor relationships in single phase circuits. We need to understand how our consumption of electricity works through balancing loads through phases. Also, learn about the circuits and the special network they can be connected to for the distribution of power across components including resistors, capacitors, and switches. This course will be of immense interest to electrical engineering students, electricians and anyone seeking to understand the inner workings and complex relationships of electrical components. Learners will gain mastery in processes for mitigating problems caused by lower power factor, active power, and reactive power. You will also analyze magnetic fields in electric rotary equipment.
