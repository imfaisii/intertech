You will learn about the thermal methods, the application of thermal analysis in the study of construction materials and how these applications or techniques are used to understand construction materials. This will lead you into differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), as well as the techniques and applications of DSC. Also, you will learn about the types of differential scanning calorimetry, the difference between differential thermal analysis and differential scanning calorimetry.</p><p>The course then enlightens you on the concept of surface area measurements performed on construction materials. You will gain an understanding of the reason for surface area measurement, laser diffraction, data analysis, as well as the surface area from laser diffraction. Next, you will study gas adsorption and BET theories. This will lead you into particle size distribution and specific surface area as typical aspects of surface area measurement training.</p><p>Finally, you will learn about spherical primary particles, irregular primary particles, agglomerates and aggregates. Also, you will learn about powder sampling, representative sample, sieving apparatus and analysis. Next, you will be informed on how to determine surface area, adsorption of a gas on the surface and the influence of degassing temperature. Furthermore, you will learn how you can report a specific surface area.
