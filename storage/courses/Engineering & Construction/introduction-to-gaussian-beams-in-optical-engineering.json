You will also learn about the mathematical derivation of the Gaussian beam by Herwig Kogelnik as well as the various properties of the Gaussian beam.</p><p>You will then study why the Gaussian beam does not have a constant divergence, as well as the reason for the changes between the straight line and the outer edge of the beam. This free online Introduction to Gaussian Beams in Optical Engineering course will teach you how to measure a distance from the current surface to the next surface through the optics software for layout and optimization (OSLO). As you work through the course content, you will learn about the various ways the Gaussian beam can be transformed with particular reference to the transformation that occurs with lenses and mirrors.&nbsp;</p><p>If youâ€™re interested in optics, optical engineering or photonic engineering and want to know more about how this relates to Gaussian beams, then enrol today for this free online course.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
