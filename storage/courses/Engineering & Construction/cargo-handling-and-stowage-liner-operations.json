The shopping industry is responsible for the transportation of most goods from manufacturers to distant shores as trade. The demand for moving fleets of cargoes rose until container ships found it difficult to move excess cargo containers on time while maintaining reasonable prices. This gave rise to the advent of liners in maritime logistics as a solution to the crisis. Liners enhance fleet productivity for shipping companies while bringing down operating costs through innovative strategies. Liners proved so profitable to maritime shipping companies that some decided to acquire them. This was achieved through mergers with competitors and fierce rivals to raise huge capital for the costly mega container ships used in today’s maritime logistics.</p><p>Your studies will cover a general outlook on liner operations in maritime logistics.
