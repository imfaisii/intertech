These are all mechatronic systems. Even your mobile phone’s camera is an example of mechatronics. This course will enlighten you about the key features of mechatronic systems and how you can use them. First, it introduces you to the essential components and definitions of mechatronics. Second, you will study the laws guiding the design of electrical circuits and the basic principles of semiconductor devices. Then you will learn about the principles of operation of various sensors such as proximity, fluid flow, and vibration sensors. Finally, the course explains the working principles of some position and acceleration sensors. More importantly, you will understand the essence of these sensors in mechatronic systems.</p><p>The course also takes you through mechanical and electrical actuation systems. You will learn about the importance of actuation systems and some examples of actuators. The material shows you the differences between hydraulic and pneumatic actuators based on their working principles and components. Electrical actuators have more advantages than mechanical actuators because they are easier to maintain and have higher reliability. You will examine how electrical actuation systems - such as solenoids, relays, and motors - operate and how reliable they are. In most engineering systems, there is a presentation system that shows the output. For example, when you use a voltmeter to measure voltage, how do you see the outcome: through a display device such as liquid crystal display (LCD). LCD is just one presentation system out there. You will learn about others and their working principles, as well as their unique usefulness in mechatronics systems. Next, discover the essence of signal conditioners in mechatronics. In combination with external elements, you will be shown how operational amplifiers can serve as signal manipulators and filters. This course describes the processes of analogue-to-digital conversion and the operational principle of the resistor ladder network digital-to-analogue converter. Lastly, you will look at the roles of artificial intelligence (AI) in mechatronics and how you can design the fuzzy logic control system to control a cooling system.</p><p>The field of mechatronics has evolved from being the electronic ignition system to a more innovative ignition system, such as digital twin-based spark ignition technology, and is still evolving. The potentials of mechatronics are endless and cut across various industries such as healthcare and manufacturing. If you are in an engineering-related field, you will find this course on mechatronics useful. Connect some of the principles you already know from your engineering profession to the operation of mechatronic systems. You will be exposed to practical circuit designs, including sensors, operational amplifiers, and some other circuit elements. Whether you are an electrical, mechanical, or automobile engineer, this course will set you apart from your peers because you will acquire the necessary details to design more intelligent engineering systems.
