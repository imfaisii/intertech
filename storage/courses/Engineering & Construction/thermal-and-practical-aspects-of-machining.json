A BEM approach is used here to analyse the thermal aspects of machining processes. Heat is always generated, when mechanical energy is converted into heat. Next we will discuss tool wear and tool life. Wear is the failure of a cutting tool due to repeated operation and loss of material from the surfaces in sliding contact. Tool is in contact with the workpiece.</p><p>Next we will discuss optimization of machining processes. It is often called the economics of machining in the books. Optimization of machining processes not only increases machining efficiency and economics, but also the end product quality. In recent years, among the traditional optimization methods, stochastic direct search optimization methods such as meta-heuristic algorithms are being increasingly applied for solving machining optimization problems.</p><p>Next we will talk about practical machining operations and concepts that can be applied to specific processes like turning, planing and shaping. Turning is performed in a lathe machine, planning usually for machining of the rectangular jobs. In the shaping, tool reciprocates and job is stationary at one point. Next we will discuss the milling and drilling process. Milling process provides intermittent cutting with each tooth producing chips of variable thickness. Finally we will discuss grinding metals and mechanics of the grinding process.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
