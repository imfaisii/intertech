This course will teach you the ennoblement of metal in relation to passivity, as well as the formation of porous deposit or barrier film on a metal surface. The different passivation potentials such as primary, complete, constant and trans-passive will also be covered in the material.</p><p>It then explains the oxygen evolution in a situation showing the interaction between polarization and Pourbaix diagrams. You will learn about the increase in current density due to transpassivity, oxygen evolution reaction, and the formation of porous film or breakdown of passive film. This course will familiarize you about the interaction between cathodic polarization and anodic polarization plots for systems in passivation mode, as well as the different criteria for stable, complete primary passivity.</p><p>Furthermore, you will study the influence of the mechanical effect of passive film after reaching concentration, as well as the effect of concentration polarization of cathodic reaction on passivity. The relationship existing between the corrosion rate to velocity and the current density will also be covered. This free online course will be of great use to anyone wanting an in-depth understanding of passivation, corrosion and metallurgy.
