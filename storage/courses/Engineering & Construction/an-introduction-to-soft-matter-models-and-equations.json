You will discuss the definition of soft materials and learn about the two types of atomic bonds and constitutive equations. Polymers, a term referring to flexible molecules that can be stretched or deformed by weak forces, will be also covered. Boost your knowledge of soft matter by studying this comprehensive mechanical engineering course.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>The various models and different equations related to the study of soft matter are covered in this free course. You will explore the two types of atomic bonds, as well as the classification of polymers and relaxation time-scales. The comprehensive demonstrations, problems, examples and assessment questions in this instructor-led video-based course, are designed to provide you with a solid foundation in the study of soft condensed matter.</p><p>The material will familiarize you with examples of soft matter materials and atomic bonds. Then, the linear concept will be discussed, which describes a type of polymer and the arrangement of the polymerization units. You will also explore the two specific types of flows that are used to characterize polymeric flows.</p><p>Next, you will learn about conservation laws and the issue of yield-stress. You will gain insight into generalized Newtonian fluids, shear stress and interatomic bonds. Finally, you will study different types of polymers, the freely jointed chain model, vectors, and tensors. This course will be of interest to mechanical engineering students or professionals in fluid mechanics or continuum mechanics.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
