Before working on various arrangements of relay contacts, it is important to understand the types of relay contacts and their operations. This course explores power contactors, chattering of relays and auxiliary relay contact multiplication. It also introduces you to monitoring, timer and electrical reset relays. The material teaches you about the types of timers for relay logic operation, how a typical control panel can be presented and the common rules that should be followed. You will learn about the operations of the control panel, as well as a rotary selector switch. Also, this course identifies the equipment that can specifically be designed to control the damage to the power system.</p><p>If you want to acquire a detailed understanding of the different symbols, ANSI numbers and single line diagrams, then you should sign up. By taking this course, you will be able to explain the process of wiring diagrams, cable schedules and how to read a schematic drawing. You will understand the structure of schematic drawings sheets and the concept of a simple control circuit. Go through the characteristics of a crane circuit, as well as the steps required for troubleshooting a typical car control circuit. Study the working principles of an annunciator and how to troubleshoot one. Do you know there are factors that must be considered before the operation of the electro-mechanical annunciator? This course discusses the sequential functioning of a typical DC electro-mechanical type annunciator. If you have difficulty understanding the working of a circuit breaker and the control scheme of a circuit breaker, then this course is for you.</p><p>Furthermore, you will learn about troubleshooting techniques of the closing and tripping schemes of a circuit breaker. You will be able to describe the trip circuit supervision procedure and the important equipment in control circuits. Explore how the steps for troubleshooting a simple control circuit can be implemented. This course improves your skills for removing problem-causing components and improving the performance of the system in the control circuits. Explore the characteristics of the attracted armature relays together with UV and OV relays. This course will improve your electrical drawings and cable schedules. It will be useful for electrical technicians and electrical engineering students who want to know more about circuit diagrams and reading blueprints.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
