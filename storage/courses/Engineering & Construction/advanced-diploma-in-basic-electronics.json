The simulation of RC and RL circuits as well as the I-V relationship of a diode and the Shockley model will also be covered. Then, the course will cover an introduction to half-wave and full-wave diode rectifiers, and a simple BJT circuit, as well as Ebers moll's model of a BJT.</p><p>This course will also teach you about the basic operation of a BJT amplifier and also, the basic form of the BJT small signal model. The general representation of an amplifier, as well as the operation of the summer, as well as the common mode rejection ratio or CMRR will also be covered in the course. The course will then teach you about the construction of Bode plots, the conversion of triangular input voltage to a sinusoidal output voltage, and operation of op-amp circuits.</p><p>You will also learn about basic logical operation, Karnaugh maps, and an introduction to the binary number system. Lastly, this course will teach you about different classes of digital circuits, and an introduction to analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion. This course is helpful for learners who want to understand the fundamentals and operations of basic electric circuits as well as their design.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
