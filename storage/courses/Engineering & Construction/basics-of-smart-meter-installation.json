This implementation requires a lot of skilled installers of smart meters so enrolling in this Green energy training course could help you to secure a fulfilling job.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Smart meters allow households to monitor their domestic energy usage and save money. As more energy companies offer smart meters to their customers' homes, more front-line advice personnel will require appropriate knowledge about the capabilities and advantages of smart meters. This course lays out the installation procedure and the regulations governing smart meters and their deployment.&nbsp;</p><p>We begin by establishing the potential and advantages of smart power grid technologies. The course then describes the different aspects of designing smart metering systems and examines their features and auxiliary components. We explain the installation process of various smart meters, including the SMETS, 50kA-3, 63A-1, 63A-3 and 65A-3 models.</p><p>The next section explores the Smart Meter Installation Code of Practice and lays out the installer's role and responsibilities during pre-installation, installation and post-installation visits. We then highlight how a smart meter’s cost/benefit analysis differs for household and non-domestic uses. Finally, we explore the policy guidelines and the various Acts related to smart meters in the UK. Sign up to take advantage of the government’s Green agenda and be a part of the national effort to modernise the UK’s energy grid and reduce both greenhouse emissions and domestic energy costs.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
