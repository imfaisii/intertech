You will study the chief and marginal rays in optical systems, along with the straight lines at the region of homogeneous refractive index. As you work through this comprehensive engineering content, you will examine the concepts of paraxial approximation, aberration, and numerical aperture in optical systems.&nbsp;</p><p>You will also learn the techniques on how to use matrices to trace elements containing refractive and reflective surfaces, as well as how to cascade various operations using the ray tracing matrix. Some other important topics include studying the concepts of principal planes, effective focal length, the six points of interest in thick and thin lenses and you will also learn how to run an optics software for layout and optimization (OSLO) operation.</p><p>Whether youâ€™re a researcher or student in the field of optical engineering or if you have an interest in optical systems and how the ray tracing matrix works, then this free online course will teach you all the basics and practical applications you need to further your knowledge. Enrol today and hone your skills in the field of optical engineering.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/2904\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
