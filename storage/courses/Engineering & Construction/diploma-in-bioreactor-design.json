One class of reactors for different catalysts requires separate unit operations to start the reactor. The size and shape of bioreactors differ to a great extent depending on the various applications in bioprocesses. This free online course introduces you to the unique features of bioreactors and classifies them based on their modes of operation, process requirements, and method of cultivating culture. Learn the basic control systems and the factors to consider before choosing a mode of operating bioreactors. The major parameters that characterize their performance and techniques to measure and control these parameters will be discussed. Discover how the internal environmental conditions such as temperature, nutrient concentrations, pH, and dissolved gases affect the growth and productivity of the organisms. Learn mathematical models to facilitate data analysis and provide a strategy for solving problems encountered in fermentation. All the possible measurements of cell concentration by direct and indirect methods of growth kinetics will be explained.</p><p>You will learn the definition of fed-batch cultivation, ideal continuous stirred tank reactor, the objectives of running fed-batch operations, and their advantages. Familiarize yourself with microbial product formation, their classification, and how to demonstrate product formation growth rate. Uncover how the volume of biomass changes with time and the flow rate of the feed. You will use the performance equation of the batch fermenter to demonstrate how cell concentration will change with time. Determine the concentration and total amount of biomass, substrate concentration, and product concentration quasi-steady state. Estimate the batch culture time and the final biomass concentration, the final mass of cells in a reactor, and how much cell biomass can be produced annually. View a graphical representation of the relationship between cell density, nutrient concentration, and dilution rate. Also, learn the mode of operation for a chemostat and how to determine the productivity of a chemostat and steady-state substrate concentration. You will use the Monod equation to describe the stimulation of growth by the concentration of nutrients, substrate consumption, and bacterial growth. Comparison in productivity between a batch and continuous reactors and descriptions of the plug flow reactor will be discussed. A graph showing the change in the concentration of cells and substrate as a function of the residence time will be analyzed.&nbsp;</p><p>The bioreactor is the heart of any biochemical process in which enzymes, microbial, mammalian, or plant cell systems are used for the manufacture of a wide range of useful biological products. The common goal in bioreactor design is to develop a reactor that provides a prolonged, sterile, culture environment with efficient mixing and oxygen transfer without producing excessive foam and hydrodynamic shears. The main function of a properly designed bioreactor is to provide a controlled environment to achieve optimal growth and product formation in the particular cell system employed. The decisions made in the design of the bioreactor have a significant impact on the overall process performance. Success depends critically on the good design and operation of the bioreactor. By completing this course, you will have crucial skills and knowledge which are in high demand in the field of biotechnology engineering. The course is suitable for learners interested in the field of bioengineering, chemical engineering, or any other related discipline. Professionals such as medical researchers, engineers, and others who are interested in refreshing their knowledge and skills will find this course beneficial.
