You will also learn about condensation, relaxation, some acoustic variables and the necessary differential equations required to obtain a wave equation. You will be introduced to the derivation of the equation of force as well as fluid acceleration. You will also learn about the Linear Continuity Equation as well as the Linear Force Equation otherwise known as Eulerâ€™s equation.</p><p>You will be introduced to velocity potential and the variation of sound speed with temperature. You will learn about the concept of energy in sound as well as harmonic plane waves. You will also learn about plane wave propagation. You will learn about the propagation of spherical waves as well as the spherical wave propagation equation. You will also learn about two functions of wave including converging wave and diverging wave.</p><p>You will be introduced to the human perception of sound and the step-by-step process of hearing. You will learn about sound pressure level loudness, intensity and the transfer functions at the periphery. You will also learn about the derivation of the oblique incidence and normal incidence. You will learn about the power transmission coefficient, the mathematical expressions of refraction and important physical properties in acoustics wave transmission.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/2420\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
