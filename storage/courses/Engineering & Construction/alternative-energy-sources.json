We begin with the pros and cons of fuel cells and their rating system based on electrolytes and operating temperature. We go on to explain why and how you should process fuel cells to increase their percentage of hydrogen content. We go through this process in detail to establish its feasibility.</p><p>The course then outlines the evolution of fuel cells to illustrate the principles that guide their production. We examine a fuel cell design that delivers power to a specific application and compares their performance when powering residential or stationary applications to their output when supplying power to automotive or mobile devices. We then explain how to characterize electrochemical devices using the single point of operation mode and generating polarization curves. The course analyzes the shape and slope of polarization curves in different regions.</p><p>We demonstrate how to assemble or disassemble a single proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) while identifying the function of each component. We then break down and compare supercapacitors, capacitors and batteries. The course then moves on to steering wheels and their function as energy storage devices. We explore magnetohydrodynamic power generation’s ability to increase the efficiency of existing power plants. This course is aimed at those who want to know more about alternative energy sources in terms of potential, costs, production and performance. This course suits anyone who is interested in learning more about the exciting new technologies that can protect the environment while meeting the world’s energy needs.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/3003\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
