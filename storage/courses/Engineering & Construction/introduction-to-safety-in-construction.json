This increase in complexity and size brings an increased emphasis on safety. This free online course breaks down various safety standards, signs and signals and provides a brief history of the development of international standards. We then lay out the roles of key stakeholders responsible for establishing safety systems for construction projects.</p><p>We then conduct a cost analysis of injury versus investment in safety and establish how safety programmes can save money. The course then introduces guidelines for setting up a safety programme for accident investigation when incidents occur. We cover personal protection equipment (PPE) and identify the various kinds of PPE designed for different body parts performing specific tasks. We explain how contractors are responsible for providing the proper equipment and training to workers.</p><p>Finally, the course conducts an interesting case study (the collapse of a Canadian hangar truss) to demonstrate how negligence and inattention to safety precautions derailed the project. Every construction professional needs to ‘Always Be Careful’ (ABC) and fulfil their safety responsibilities on site. This free online course suits designers, site engineers, contractors or anyone planning on building something. Sign up for this course before you pick up a hammer as it will help to keep you (and the hammer) safe.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
