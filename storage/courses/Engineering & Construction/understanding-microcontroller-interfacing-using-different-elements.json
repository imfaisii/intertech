This free online course is designed to help you understand the best techniques to interface LEDs, switches and buttons, and other electronic devices as well as how to design a circuit for each electronic device, how to program code to embed these devices to a PIC microcontroller, and how to use software to run simulations.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Microcontrollers have become very useful in embedded design because they can easily communicate with other devices, such as LCD displays, switches, LED lights, sensors, keypads, motors, and many other electrical components. As a result, they can be used in various applications, from automation in industrial machinery to small electrical devices. Over the years, many interfacing methods have been developed and this PIC Microcontroller course will show you the best practices available for interfacing PIC microcontrollers even if you have little to no experience in electronics. All you need is a computer capable of downloading the necessary software and then you will be able to interface commonly used devices, such as switches, relays, transistors, and practice creating circuits and simulations. Included in this course is basic programming training which will help you with your configurations.</p><p>The Educational Engineering Team is an organization with vast experience in the microcontroller field who exist to assist engineering students worldwide to reach their engineering goals and will guide you through each step of this course. The software you need to start this course is available to download for free and you will receive all the information necessary to familiarize yourself with mikroC Pro, Proteus, and PICSimla which will ultimately assist you in creating circuits, run simulations, and program code. Worried about your coding experience? We have you covered. Coding resources are provided and we would recommend that you do take some time to analyze each line of code in order to learn how to use it. As you work through the code and build various circuits, you will learn the difference between a ‘source logic circuit’ and a ‘sink logic circuit’ and the distinction between a ‘pull-up resistor’ and a ‘pull-down resistor’.</p><p>Another exciting section of this free online PIC Microcontroller tutorial will have you study how to interface LCDs, use PICSimlab to run simulations on a virtual LCD screen and to write any message for LCD screens using the computer programming language. What if you want to connect a device to a PIC Microcontroller that requires more current output than what your microcontroller can provide? This electronics course will teach you what to do including how to use transistors, Darlington Driver IC devices, and relays to provide the current output you need without short-circuiting or burning your microcontroller. Once you master the techniques to design these circuits, you will be able to interface just about any electronic device with your microcontroller. If you work with electronics or are studying electrical engineering, understanding how to interface, or connect PIC microcontrollers with electronic components is a crucial skill to have. Soon, you will be an expert in interfacing different electronic elements with any microcontroller by enrolling in this exciting, easy-to-follow course.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
