The Soil Science and Technology - Soil Chemistry and Testing Procedures course is the third in a suite of free online courses that provides extensive information on soil chemistry, essential plant nutrients, and soil testing procedures. This course begins with a discussion on the exchangeable cations in field soils and the sorption of pesticides in the soil.</p><p>Next, you will study the models of the diffuse double layer along with the effects of electrolytes on the zeta potential and adsorption isotherms. You will also study the causes, effects, and amelioration of soil acidity, salinity, and alkalinity. Then, you will take a look at the characteristics of submerged soils and electrochemical changes. Furthermore, you will learn about essential plant nutrients and different fixation systems in the soil. You will also analyze fertilizer grades and methods of application. Finally, you will study the parameters and procedures for soil testing.</p><p>This free online course provides you with the required knowledge of soil chemistry, plant nutrients, and soil testing parameters for determining and managing plant growth. This course will be of great interest to students, researchers, agriculturists, and anyone with an interest in understanding soil mechanisms as well as improving soil productivity. Begin this course today and improve your knowledge of managing soil properties and the optimal use of plant nutrients.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/2304\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
