From its early beginnings as a steam engine, the piston engine has revolutionized the way we live, work and travel. This course examines this amazing machine and explains the 2-stroke and 4-stroke cycles in detail. We then cover the starting circuit, diesel engine control and diesel engine maintenance strategies to show you how to protect them.</p><p>We employ interactive 3D models to illustrate each individual engine component as we explain how these components work together to complete their work. Sign up to take your knowledge of combustion engines to the next level with our advanced diesel engine course. Engineers and mechanics should be familiar with the internal workings of these important machines.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
