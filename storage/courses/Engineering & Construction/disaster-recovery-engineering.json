Your industry hence needs a business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) plan to forestall all such occurrences. ‘Business continuity’ refers to the actions, decisions, procedures and processes that ensure an organization can retain functionality in the face of operational disruption. Alternatively, a disaster recovery plan is a predefined strategy for restoring the business to maximum operations after a system breakdown or compromise.</p><p>Business Continuity involves two distinct areas: business continuity planning (BCP) and business continuity management (BCM).
