Understanding the key elements of the field of electricity gives you a solid foundation and the ability to apply them properly to solve electrical faults and do safe installations. This free course provides you with up-to-date theories, elements, and analyses of electricity along with their application that will help you grasp all the essential concepts of this important technology.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>The physical phenomena of electricity is a vast subject. This online course takes you through some of the main aspects of electricity and its application. Do you know what sort of current is used in batteries? We start off with an explanation of alternate and direct currents. Both these are key parts of alternate current (AC) theory. In addition, we examine the use of AC voltages and currents functioning all around us. Terms such as waveforms and harmonics will be defined and the computation of average and RMS (root mean square) value will be looked at. Graphical representations and mathematical equations are used to illustrate the concepts of form factor and amplitude. Phasor representation and power of AC circuits is a major part of electrical studies. The methodology used in the application of these concepts will be described.</p><p>Have you ever wondered what the key elements of the circuits that are around us are made up of? Or what the components of the batteries that we use are? The answer to these questions is provided by the next section of the course that examines network elements. Real examples and illustrations will be used to analyze active and passive elements, and bilateral and unilateral networks. The working of linear and lumped networks will also be discussed. The conversion of a current source into a voltage source and vice versa are crucial electrical subjects. The theory and methods used to carry out these procedures will be the next focus of attention. The understanding of important theorems and the analysis of mesh and nodes will be developed through examples and demonstrations.</p><p>The final section delves into the method of alternate current generation, transmission and distribution. The generation of three-phase voltages and phase sequences is described in detail. An analysis of three-phase circuits with star and delta connections is carried out in order to understand these concepts properly. Both balanced and unbalanced loads will also be examined. All of these elements will be explained with formula computation, key diagrams, and demonstrations.
