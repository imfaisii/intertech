The quality of building projects often depends on structural execution, from laying the foundation to finishing works. The main finishing activities of building construction include the facing, flooring (and parquetry), painting, tiling, and interior designs. The purpose of the finishing works is to protect the building from adverse weather conditions and to add aesthetic value to the structure. Construction methodology involves the temporary and permanent work and services required to complete a construction project. It also refers to the planned method of this profession, taking into account all contractual and legal requirements, construction constraints, and risks and opportunities. In this free online course, we will start by showing you how to use brickworks for a planned construction system. Then, we will show you the different types of bricks and how to make and store them to ensure they remain strong.</p><p>Next, we will examine concrete works and how to make reinforcements in concretes. We will also discuss the details surrounding electrical and plumbing works. You will also learn how to translate structural drawings. We will look into frame fixing for windows and doors and the materials to be used for the process. The course also covers procedures for plastering inside and outside walls and mixing ratios of cement and sand required for the practice. Moving on to some of the more refined finishings, we will look into the nitty-gritty of floor and wall tiling. You will learn which tiling activity should come first, how to cut and lay the tiles, as well as the systems for calculating the required number of tiles. Learn how to interpret the interior components of a construction design, including the living hall, dining, bedroom, storage cabinet, kitchen, washrooms, to mention a few. You will also learn about using wall paints for design and decorations.</p><p>Finally, we will examine some POP design options and the costs of the materials used for each design. We will explore some unique concepts about the settings and the designs for the kitchen, washroom, and master bedroom. We will explain formwork, staging and its components, and the differences between staging and scaffolding. Then, weâ€™ll study the systems for recognizing and interpreting the finishing activities of building construction from architectural drawings. Whether you are an aspiring civil engineer, engineering trainee, professional building contractor, or experienced structural engineer, this course will refresh your knowledge or take your construction skills to the next level. The material offered in this course is fully packed with exciting and informative sessions about modern building technologies and professional project management techniques. By completing this course, you will learn how to manage, monitor, and direct the successful completion of the finishing activities of a building project. So, why wait? Take advantage of this course today and acquire the professional skills to become an exceptional civil engineer.
