Engine room ventilation arrangement, as well as the importance of the engine room ventilation systems, will be covered in this course. You will learn about the difference between fans, blowers and compressors, as well as the factors to consider when selecting a fan and fan maintenance. The material will teach you about the maintenance and monitoring of shipboard ventilation components, as well as the working principles of a vapour-compression refrigerant cycle. The relationship between the refrigerant cycle and coefficient of performance, as well as the vapour compression cycle, will also be covered. You will be introduced to the brine and direct expansion system, as well as the main components of a direct expansion refrigeration system. You will also learn about the operations of a refrigeration system, as well as safety devices needed to protect compressors.</p><p>The course then explains the concept and functions of the ‘cascade system’, as well as the concepts of ‘coupling temperature’ and ‘optimum coupling temperature’. You will learn about the functions of the multiple compression and evaporator system. The features, functions, components, as well as advantages of the indirect expansion system, will also be covered. You will be taught about the preparations of holds for loading refrigerated cargo, precautions for loading, handling refrigerated cargo, as well as the processes for the inspection of cargo. The principles of air-conditioning, the psychometric properties of air, as well as comfort conditions and control of humidity will also be tackled. You will study airflow, air-conditioning capacity, and air-conditioning systems, as well as the components of the direct expansion air-conditioning system. The material will teach you about different types of compressors and compressor designs, as well as the reciprocating compression efficiency and lubrication system. The components of a reefer system, as well as the functions of the condenser and evaporator, will be analyzed.</p><p>Furthermore, this course will help you get familiar with the patterns of coolant flow, double pipe heat exchanger, as well as heat exchanger maintenance. You will also learn about the handling of oil in a system, safe isolation of a system, as well as management of oil return. The single compressor and multi compressor system, as well as the processes of adding oil to the system, will be detailed, and you will get familiar with how oil contaminates a reefer system, the detrimental effects of oil in a system and the key functions of oil in a refrigeration system. You will learn about four main techniques selected in the design of separators, as well as how oil separators work. The testing of compressor discharger and suction valves, as well as reasons for defrosting and defrosting systems, will also be explored. This free online course will be of great interest to marine supply chain students and professionals with an interest in marine refrigeration and climate control.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
