It covers various essential machine shop equipment such as measuring gauges and marking tools. You will also be taken through what hand tools are, along with common examples such as screwdrivers, pliers, vises, and tweezers. Hand tools are devices that can perform operations on a physical system only by the use of human hands. With this course, you will be able to identify the different types of cutting tools like hacksaws, snips, and cold chisels. Cutting tools are used to remove the material or separate the physical object into portions by applying force. You will gain additional insight into surface-finishing and drilling tools. Surface finishing is the process of reducing the surface roughness after a machining process like turning or cutting. The drilling process involves making holes of different dimensions. You will also learn about various works in metals like filing, cutting and internal and external threading.</p><p>Next, analyze the procedure of improving the sharpness of workshop tools by re-sharpening them. This course takes you through the processes and procedures involved in metal sheet handling including cutting, bending, and riveting. It also covers the processes and procedures followed in cutting wood using a hand saw, planing, chiseling, drilling, countersinking, and assembly. Finally, you will learn about the construction of hand coil wiring machines, electrical extension boards, and an open metal box for covering machines. It is essential to understand the practical and theoretical aspects of the fundamentals of workshop or machine shop technology as an engineer or trainee.</p><p>This course is straightforward with texts and videos to explain each of the points thoroughly. You will be required to answer some questions at the end of each module to assess your level of understanding of the content. You will learn about marking tools, the different steps in a machine process and the functions of a vernier calliper. You will be taken through the types of measuring gauges together with handling, cutting, and drilling tools. The course explains metal filing practices and the procedure of re-sharpening of tools. You also learn the different methods of filing and the procedures of bending metal sheets and riveting. Additionally, the processes of drilling and countersinking will be discussed. Lastly, you will learn about the construction of a mild sheet open box that is used to cover the machines with an external shield to protect them from the atmosphere. This course is designed for engineering students, practising engineers wanting revision and anyone with an interest in workshop tools and practices. Does this sound interesting to you?
