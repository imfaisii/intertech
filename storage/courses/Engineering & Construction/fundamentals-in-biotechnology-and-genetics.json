You will see how they have revolutionized diagnostics and therapeutic intervention. In the first section, learn about human genome sequencing and its accomplishments. You will also study the facets of gene expression, and the various steps involved in RNA preparation and cDNA synthesis will be explained.</p><p>Next, consider how genetic engineering technology can be applied to move the genes from an unrelated organism and introduced to plants. See how this modification has the potential to increase the quality and quantity of food production worldwide and possibly solve some other major problems. You will learn about the principles of Mendelian genetics that feature the laws of segregation and independent assortment, before considering the significance of these laws and their consistency in the natural world. Some deviations from Mendelian genetics will also be highlighted.</p><p>Finally, you will learn about the rules of probability as they pertain to genetics. Study some of the challenges clinicians face relating to genetic disorders and the role artificial intelligence can play in solving some of these problems. This course will be beneficial to anyone in the field of bioengineering, genetic engineering, biotechnology, medicine and other related disciplines.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/2869\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
