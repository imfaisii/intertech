It is defined as ‘the industry in which agricultural products are transformed into food, or in which one form of food is converted into another form’. Food safety is one of the industry’s top priorities and serious effort goes into ensuring that food is free from biological, chemical and physical hazards that could harm consumers’ health. Food safety and protection is thus a crucial consideration for both food manufacturers and the governments that regulate their work.</p><p>The ‘Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points’ (HACCP) food safety system is a globally recognized, science-based and systematic approach to identifying and controlling all types of food safety hazards. Adoption of the HACCP system by Codex Alimentarius Commission of the United Nations and other international organizations has made it the basis for all modern food safety regulations and standards. This course is designed for anyone who works in the food processing industry who wants to understand and implement the HACCP system in their business. We explore the necessary prerequisite programs (PRPs) of HACCP and explain how to take the preliminary steps of implementing it as we lay out its seven principles.</p><p>This food safety and protection course is of great benefit to all food industry managers, technologists, supervisors, technicians and workers who need to implement the HACCP food safety system. We provide theoretical and practical information to help you carry out each HACCP step and abide by the system’s principles. We also present a wide range of real-world examples from various food industries to make the guidelines clear and easy to follow. The course also offers a great starting point for those who want to further implement food safety management systems (FSMS) standards such as ISO 22000, FSSC 22000 and BRCGS in their food processing establishments. Sign up to learn how to use HACCP to protect food from contamination and yourself from legal liability.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5527\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
