Tragically, many of the original lessons and methods have been lost. How are you able to complete a course dedicated to teaching you about healing techniques based on Reiki if they were lost to the ages? Thanks to its rediscovery in the nineteenth century, this course is able to introduce you to the first and second degrees of this healing discipline. As you progress you will familiarize yourself with the history of Reiki and the lives of the ‘grandmasters’ who aided in its rediscovery. You will also learn about human anatomy and how you can heal yourself and others using Reiki in conjunction with the major chakra points and the universal life force. These lessons, along with its guiding principles, initiation ceremony and life-giving energy, will be discussed in your introduction to Reiki.</p><p>Second-degree Reiki takes a closer look at distance healing - or healing that you send over distance or even in the same room as you, using Reiki techniques. Also included in the second degree is the use of symbols and their meanings. There is a huge ensemble of symbols that are sacred and important to Reiki practitioners and, by knowing these, you will also be able to become involved in ceremonies. Learn about the different ceremonies that are celebrated and understand how to perform some key Reiki techniques. Once you feel confident drawing specific symbols and knowing what they are used for, the material will guide you in using these during ceremonies to help people, animals or even global events and disasters. By introducing you to other healing disciplines, you will be shown how they can work in conjunction with Reiki and you will be able to focus on more advanced techniques, like animal care.</p><p>The course also covers the benefits of Reiki during pregnancy for all involved. You will learn how expectant mothers and fathers can use Reiki before birth, as well as into adolescence. As you continue your studies, you will learn about the pillars of Reiki and how they were used to create the guiding principles of this healing discipline. This will also lead to the importance of ‘Namaste’ (the respectful greeting) and the role it plays in Reiki. This course finishes with non-traditional symbols that can also be used during different ceremonies for a variety of purposes. Hand healing is the main pillar upon which Reiki depends and this course on the first and second degrees will hope to encourage you to continue and study the third degree and practice this holistic method in your everyday life.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/3440\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
