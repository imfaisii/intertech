Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.</p><p><br>The course discusses how this virus outbreak had severe consequences for the health of individuals infected and the implications for the public health resources of communities and countries where the outbreak occurred. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In addition, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death in more severe cases.</p><p><br>The course was a unique initiative based on information provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland, and the CDC (Centre of Disease Control, USA). This course was part of an innovative Alison endeavour to develop a rapid response to a global learning certification system to combat pandemic diseases. This free course will be regularly updated as the virus progresses and new VOCs (variants of concern) are tracked. Alison has made this PDF Certification course available free of charge worldwide to encourage knowledge, awareness and understanding of the virus and its threat. By taking this course, you can maintain the latest updates on how to best deal with the danger Covid-19 poses to you and others and follow updated protocols to keep everyone safe. So, why wait?
