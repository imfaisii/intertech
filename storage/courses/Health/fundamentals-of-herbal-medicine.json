Herbal medicine traces its roots back to the earliest civilizations and continues to flourish as a popular healing art. According to the World Health Organisation, 80% of the world’s population used some form of traditional herbal medicine in 2008 and its rate of affordability, availability and accessibility is surging. In this course, Amer Taha, a medical health expert with years of experience, guides you on your journey to using herbal medicine for your wellbeing and that of your family members, friends or patients.</p><p>If you use herbs in cooking, you have already taken the first step in using herbal medicine. Our common culinary herbs and spices are among our most important and esteemed herbal medications. You are also considered to be 'practising' herbal medicine if you garden while tucking herbs here and there for added scent and beauty. This course will illustrate their overall benefit. We will discuss how to start a home garden and set up your ‘kitchen pharmacy’. You will learn the different processes used to convert garden herbs into medicines. These techniques include making infusions, decoctions, syrups, medicinal oils, salves, tinctures and pills. Further on, we will examine the science behind determining the dosage and duration of herbal treatments.</p><p>You will examine some thirty different herbs, analysing their unique properties. Gain a clear understanding of how to use them for various treatments. The course intends to help you start using herbs to enhance your health and wellbeing, reintroducing the traditional home health care practice for common everyday illnesses but not replacing the guidance of trained healthcare professionals. If you are interested in learning traditional herbal medicine at home or are a health practitioner interested in extending these treatments to your clients, you have come to the right place.
