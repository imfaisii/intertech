These transport accidents are usually considered to be “unintentional” by survivors, demonstrating the importance of safety and emergency preparedness. Who do you imagine will be the next victim of an accident? You? A family member? A friend? The answer is likely to be anyone, as long they are somehow involved in transportation. Involvement could even include bystanders on seashores or road pavements, and people residing close to airports. For this reason, it is necessary to understand the safety requirements around popular transportation forms including air, water, and road transportation. Passengers and bystanders who manage to survive such accidents usually owe their luck to interventions from people who were acquainted with emergency procedures. Such procedures include administering first aid as well as properly using emergency equipment and life-saving appliances. This course specifically discusses emergency concepts surrounding watercraft before, during, and after voyages on sea.</p><p>‘Shipboard Safety: Emergency Equipment and Life-Saving Appliances’ is a free online course that is specially designed for learners interested in the workings of ships where the watercraft and those on board are exposed to different hazards. Maritime transportation used to face huge backlash from the public due to the frequency of accidents recorded in the 20th century. This is, however, a thing of the past as records show a reduced amount of global maritime disasters due to improved safety measures. This proves that learning about emergency equipment and life-saving appliances is important in reducing loss of life, pollution of global waters, and grand-scale economic loss. Furthermore, the regulations surrounding emergency equipment discussed in this course cover aspects beyond shipboard concepts, crossing over into daily life and including all sorts of machines. Mariners from around the world would benefit from re-learning and updating their command of safety appliance usage through the completion of this course.</p><p>The sinking of the <em>Titanic</em> is often regarded as one of the most fatal safety tragedies of the 20th century. It led to the loss of no fewer than 1,500 lives and the destruction of man’s most valuable ship of that era. As a result of this, the safety of ships has been improved through developments in life-saving appliances with the memory of past fatalities. Also, the various pieces of ship equipment discussed in this course are linked to the lessons learned from inadequate emergency tools analyzed from sunken ships. This course further gives credit to the agencies formed and protocols set because of past incidents on board ships. Without which standardization of emergency procedures, improved training in using equipment and overall shipboard safety would be difficult to commend these days. Students, mariners, maritime enthusiasts and anyone interested in learning about shipboard safety cannot afford to miss this course.
