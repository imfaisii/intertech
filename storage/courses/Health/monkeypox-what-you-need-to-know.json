The virus, formerly called monkeypox, is endemic to parts of Africa; however, in May 2022, cases began to appear in different parts of Europe, the USA, Canada and beyond that were not connected to travel from African hotspots. While it is not as contagious as coronavirus and not as deadly as its predecessor smallpox, mpox is still of concern. Patients are advised to isolate themselves for 21 days to avoid spreading the infection further - and in some countries, that applies to close contacts too. In this course, you will learn the background of the spread of mpox in humans, its connection to the eradication of smallpox globally and the accompanying cessation of vaccination programmes.</p><p>The course explores the development of the mpox outbreak in 2022 and the international response as medical researchers race to find answers to exactly how and why it has spread to other countries. You will learn the mpox symptoms and the typical incubation period before they appear. There usually are two phases in mpox cases: an initial period when the patient feels unwell and then the appearance of the distinctive rash a few days later. Discover how to avoid contracting the virus and what you should do if you catch it. While there is no specific treatment yet, most cases are mild and the illness runs its course naturally. However, mpox can cause difficulties, particularly for children and those with suppressed immune systems, so everyone has a role to play in preventing the further spread of infection.&nbsp;</p><p>The earliest cases of the 2022 outbreak of mpox may have occurred in homosexual and bisexual men but experts believe that it is not a sexually transmitted disease and that patients have contracted it through close contact. Nevertheless, like any virus, mpox can affect anyone, so why not make sure you know exactly what you could be dealing with. Being informed is the best defence against any infectious disease. Our free course will be regularly updated with the latest advice and information so you can enrol, safe in the knowledge that you are being kept thoroughly up to date.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4768\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
