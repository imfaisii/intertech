This course, designed by Alpha Academy, will investigate special education for students with disabilities and developmental disorders. The term SEN or Special Education Needs describes a child or young adult who has a learning difficulty or disability that makes it harder for them to learn or access education in the same way as their peers.</p><p>The lessons will begin by discussing the most important UK SEN legislature. These laws make it possible for children and young people with disabilities to receive assistance from their early education setting, school, or college, sometimes with the assistance of outside specialists. Next, we will examine how disabilities are caused. During infancy or childhood, these limitations manifest as delays in reaching developmental miles stones.</p><p>Afterwards, you will discover the different categories of SEN and the risk factors of certain disabilities like poverty, stigma and discrimination. Special needs students are likely to benefit from additional educational services such as SEN technologies and adapted teaching areas. As you will see, this process involves the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching procedures. Discover what difference the proper knowledge and skills in this area will mean for your special needs students.
