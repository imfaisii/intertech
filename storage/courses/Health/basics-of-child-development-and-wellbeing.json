The early years of children's lives are crucial for their long-term health and development. A caring family that provides a safe home in which parents love and spend time with their children can make a big difference to children’s wellbeing and growth.</p><p>This childcare course examines the basics of child development and lays out the milestones that mark children's growth. We examine the stages that define age-based child development from birth through infancy and adolescence. We also study the period from when children start coordinating their smiles to when they begin expressing emotions and participating in word games. The course explores some theories of child development, including the constructivist, behaviourist theory and social learning models.&nbsp;</p><p>The course then highlights the external and personal factors that affect child development. We explain how physical transitions affect children and how you can help your child manage the process by building good relationships with people. We study the five aspects of development and show you how to meet a child's special education (SEN) needs. We identify some barriers to child development and establish the significance of early intervention for children with disabilities.
