While ‘telemedicine’ refers specifically to remote clinical services, ‘telehealth’ can refer to remote non-clinical services, such as provider training, administrative meetings and continuing medical education. We have therefore designed this course to teach you the fundamentals of telehealth. First, we begin with a general overview of telemedicine. Then you'll discover telemedicine communication methods, their benefits, drawbacks and possible solutions for body area networks.</p><p>You will learn about the regulations and standards that govern telemedicine operations. Next, explore clinical applications of telemedicine and clinician-to-clinician telemedicine, including continuous live monitoring and telesurgery, which is one of the most exciting aspects of telemedicine. Like any other industry, telemedicine faces various challenges and potential solutions. This course will discuss these issues, along with the rules governing the use of telemedicine by private practitioners and the security and associated privacy concerns.</p><p>This course discusses the best practices in telehealth and the benefits of virtual mental health programs, which include increasing access to mental health services for a broader range of people, including those without transportation and those who are housebound due to physical or mental illness. Familiarise yourself with the applications of telehealth by enrolling in this course today.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4909\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
