Healthy feet are essential to prevent damage to these crucial assets and our overall health. The primary role of a foot health practitioner is to help people with foot problems. This course begins with a comprehensive guide on becoming a foot health practitioner. We demonstrate how to assess the condition of a patient's feet to provide the necessary treatment. You will examine the complex structure and systems of the foot and develop an understanding of their roles and functions. Clinical thinking skills are acquired rather than taught as you gain experience and improve personal judgement. Explore various aspects of the examination and diagnosis of foot diseases, the importance of taking a patient history and applying clinical thinking to the information collected. Foot health practitioners require different equipment and tools to trim or cut nails and remove skin around nails. You will gain knowledge of podiatric instruments, their use, features and handling mechanisms.</p><p>Foot problems are common in adults, can severely limit their ability to move and negatively impact their overall quality of life. Learn about the basics of clinical biomechanics of the foot, various physical and neurological diseases and suitable approaches to inspect and treat these disorders. Toenails are a vital part of the foot and shield against shock and injury to the bones and skin tissues underneath them. Unfortunately, they are also susceptible to a wide array of diseases and disorders. First, you will study some common nail diseases and the various pathological conditions that can reduce an individual's healing potential or lead to an increased susceptibility to infection and necrosis. Next, we will show you the standard techniques for managing high-risk patients and how to tackle varying degrees of risks during foot treatments. Following that, you will investigate the proper procedure for a basic pedicure and the techniques and benefits of a foot and leg massage.</p><p>We designed this course for people who want to pursue a career in foot health. This course is also helpful for people who are already serving in the foot health industry and want to refresh their knowledge and learn new skills. It does not require prior knowledge or experience, allowing anyone to take the course. We explain various podiatric techniques and procedures in simple language and divide them into easy-to-follow steps. Globally, the field of foot health offers multiple employment prospects with high monthly income for foot health professionals. The government of the U.K. approved the Accredited Register of Foot Health Practitioners under the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Are you inspired to become a foot health practitioner?
