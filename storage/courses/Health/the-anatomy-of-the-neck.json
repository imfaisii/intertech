The various layers within the neck structure can sometimes go through dysfunctions. This allows infections to spread across multiple parts of the neck. We will examine these and how they can penetrate through the layers within the cervical fascia.

We will analyse this complex structure in detail using illustrations.</p><p>Do you know of someone going through a case of 'wry neck'?
