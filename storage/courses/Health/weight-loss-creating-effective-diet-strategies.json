Many factors play a role in this process, including genetics, but the most important are within your control: lifestyle modifications. Those who try to lose weight without modifying their lifestyle and diet are doomed to struggle in vain. This nutrition course from Element Recipe is designed to help you take control of the process and provides various tips used to develop effective strategies and lifestyle modifications that can be sustained to lose weight and keep it off.</p><p>This course builds on the lessons taught in its predecessor, ‘Essentials of Weight Reduction and Lifestyle Modification - Part 1’, which covers the science of weight loss. This course in turn focuses more on practical tips and strategies you can employ to make significant long-term lifestyle changes. The course can help anyone take control of their weight and suits nutrition professionals to draw up effective diet plans for their clients.</p><p>We then examine strategies used to spend a dietary ‘cheat day’ constructively. We explain the two essential ways to implement a successful dietary break and identify the correct length and frequency of such pauses to make them aid the weight-loss process. The course describes some of the typical causes of rapid weight gain before providing practical ways to counter them. We show you how to make dietary modifications, increase protein uptake and develop healthy eating and lifestyle habits. Whether you are looking to lose weight yourself or are interested in a career as a dietician, this nutrition course provides practical information to help you or your clients look and feel great.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
