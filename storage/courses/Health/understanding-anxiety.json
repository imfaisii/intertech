As a result, learning how to manage these anxious thoughts and keep them at bay has become increasingly important. The course publisher, Amer Taha, is a medical professional and life coach. He has designed this course to give you a clear understanding of anxiety, equipping you with the knowledge you need to take control of your emotions and make better decisions for a healthier, fulfilling life.</p><p>We begin by exploring the anatomy of anxiety and examining the brain's functions. The brain is designed to create emotions like fear and anxiety for good reason. However, living for prolonged periods with stress is harmful and can cause a web of physical and psychological problems. Study how the brain works to create a fight, flight or freeze response and panic attacks. The better you understand how and why these emotions manifest, the easier it will be to reprogramme your brain to function to your advantage. Reprogramming is possible and rewires the brain to respond differently, enabling you to react more calmly and rationally to stressful situations.</p><p>Furthermore, you will discover specific techniques and treatments to manage fears and stress emotions triggered by circumstances, whether real or imagined. We will discuss the benefits of exercise and sleep, among other remedies proven to improve a person's quality of life. Lastly, you will study the significance of imagery and relaxation. Added to the resource section are the transcripts for the course and other materials for your personal reflection and study. If you or someone you care for is experiencing persistent bouts of anxiety, you will find this free online course helpful in identifying the right tools you can use to overcome it.
