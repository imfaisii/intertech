It is the effort of licenced and trained professionals to restore an individual's emotional, mental, and physical well-being. The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains that, as countries commit to achieving \"Health for All,\" it is critical to evaluate the quality of care and health services. Hence, quality care must be equitable, timely, integrated, safe, and people-centred.</p><p>In this free online course, we consider the basic framework for health and safety in the United Kingdom. We outline the general duties of an employer in substance handling and storage, safety and welfare of personnel, and staff training. Likewise, we examine the legislative framework for care-providing organisations and the key sources of information and guidance for health and safety in the UK. Study the approaches to infection prevention and control in care homes and offices, including how to adopt standard guidelines to stop and limit the transmission of infection.</p><p>The next section will go over healthcare-associated infections and responses to infection outbreaks. Learn how to use root cause analysis (RCA) as an investigative tool and how you can utilise risk assessment methodologies to determine the efficiency of protective safeguards. Finally, we review the factors that cause infection spread, infection prevention methods, and infection risk assessment strategies in the United Kingdom.
