What about having a simple headache? These could be symptoms of neurological disorders that respond to internal or external stimuli. The body's neural systems manage the responses to these stimuli, but they also do a lot more. In this course, we will show you the organisation of the neural system in the brain and spinal cord and provide the foundation for understanding the complicated pathophysiology of the nervous system. Neurology is the branch of medicine that studies nerves and the treatment of disorders of the nervous system. With an ageing population, neurological diseases represent an increasing economic burden to society and cause much suffering to patients, caregivers and loved ones. We will provide you with a thorough understanding of various neurological conditions, allowing you to recognise the signs and symptoms of different neurological deficits in both adults and children.</p><p>The peripheral nervous system (PNS) coordinates activity and responses by transferring signals from one part of the body to another, in conjunction with the central nervous system (CNS). You will gain insight into the anatomy of the central and peripheral nervous system and the overall organisation of sensory and motor systems in the brain and spinal cord. We help you grasp the fundamentals of seizures and epilepsy, inherited and acquired neuromuscular diseases, central nervous system infections, tumours, migraines and other neurological diseases. We use our vision to see myriad elements of the world distant from our bodies, as do other primates with forward-facing eyes. Explore the human visual systems and the different visual disorders caused by various neurological and other conditions. We investigate the symptoms of these conditions before exploring the auditory system and types of disorders associated with hearing impairment.</p><p>Finally, we outline the common signs and symptoms related to a single or multiple nerve structure dysfunction in any neurological condition and explain how to recognise these problems in both the young and the old. Research the neurological screening methods and diagnostics that are applied in day-to-day clinical practice. Are you interested in pursuing a career in Neurology? This course will provide an excellent foundation for students pursuing Bachelors of Medicine, physiotherapy or nursing and can also benefit medical professionals who feel the need to brush up on the fundamentals. It also suits those who have a particular interest in understanding the complexities of the brain. There are no prerequisites to take the course and all you need is a passion for learning.
