It delves into cardiac issues, including heart failure, inflammations and valve abnormalities, to enrich your cardiology nursing skills.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Community-based nurses and other health care professionals increase physician care and are well known for their effectiveness in supporting cardiovascular health. Cardiovascular nurses have played a significant role in promoting cardiovascular health ever since the institution of coronary care units in the 1960s. Since then, cardiology nursing has progressed tremendously in tandem with technological advancements and breakthroughs in the control and diagnosis of heart disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of mortality globally; the future role of nurses is exciting but it requires education and experience to research high-quality coronary heart disease nursing care. Cardiac nurses play a vital role in preventing, detecting and providing therapy for heart conditions. Cardiology nursing services are required not only to care for patients but also to encourage healthy lifestyle choices.&nbsp;</p><p>The nurse practitioner position in the care of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is well established in the modern world as they engage with patients with chronic conditions in direct and indirect (nurse-led clinics) roles. Nurses can play a vital part in treating the risks of coronary artery disease in a low-resource context. As a medical professional, you need a deep understanding of cardiac anatomy and physiology to recognise the appropriate care for individuals with cardiac diseases. Likewise, you should acknowledge the limitations of those who suffer from heart diseases and correctly administer recommended drugs and therapies to individuals with heart problems safely and knowledgeably. This course strives to deliver an introductory experience of cardiovascular disorders. We begin with the biological structure of the electrical mechanism of the heart. Subsequently, review a comprehensive presentation of the available detection systems for acute coronary syndrome. Finally, interpret cardiac chest pain signals as the consequences of myocardial infarction.</p><p>By the end of the course, you will be able to improve your ability in influencing the health-related lifestyles and self-care habits of your cardiology patients. Define the origin, pathophysiology and symptoms of common cardiac illnesses, including hypertension and atherosclerosis. Complete your training by discussing the effects and nursing implications of widely administered drugs for patients with heart problems. Rhonda Lawes is a Certified Nurse Educator (CNE) and an Assistant Professor at the University of Oklahoma College of Nursing. She will be your tutor, breaking lessons into straightforward, easy-to-understand topics. Encouraging cardiovascular health among all individuals and emphasising prevention substantially reduces barriers to multidisciplinary collaboration and broad community participation.
