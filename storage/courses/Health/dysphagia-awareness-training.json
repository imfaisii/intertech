Swallowing is a complicated procedure because it involves numerous nerves and muscles, including the brain, working together to carry food and drinks from the mouth to the stomach. As a result, any flaw in the process poses a risk of dysphagia. The treatment approach for dysphagia varies depending on what caused it. In this course, we’ll teach you about this swallowing disorder and describe its causes, symptoms, diagnosis and control methods. We establish the importance of good oral health.</p><p>The course then makes a distinction between the incidence of a disorder and the prevalence of infection. Dysphagia is often accompanied by phobias that affect a patient's quality of life, making it difficult for them to enjoy meals and social gatherings. We lay out the medical and psychological consequences of dysphagia and identify the specialists that can help alleviate them. We study the anatomical and physiological structures that are involved in the swallowing process and identify their functions and locations. The course also covers the mechanisms governing the stimulation of taste in the mouth and describes the role of saliva and temperature and pressure receptors.</p><p>The final part of this course examines the symptoms of dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia caused by food entering a patient’s airways. You'll learn about pseudobulbar palsy (a condition that impairs one's ability to control the facial muscles) and the role of evidence-based medicine in the diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia. We discuss the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI), its framework and the toolkits used in its implementation. We examine the important oral healthcare procedures used to treat dysphagia, including periodontal treatment and maintenance. Dysphagia can either be mild or severe and should be taken seriously because it affects one's quality of life. This course doesn't demand any prerequisite knowledge and dentists, nutritionists, orthodontists and other healthcare providers can benefit from it.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5102\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
