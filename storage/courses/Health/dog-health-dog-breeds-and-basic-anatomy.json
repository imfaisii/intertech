Explore the many dog breeds, their characteristics, life expectancy, anatomy and more.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>A dog is mankind's best buddy and a healthy dog is happy. You don't have to wait for your dog to act strangely before paying attention to it. There are several factors to consider while raising your four-legged friend to stay in top form physically and mentally. A healthy canine pet saves you more money by keeping you away from the veterinarian. What can we do to keep a dog healthy? Study the factors you can check to ensure they feel better and stay fit. It is recommended to take your dog for a vet visit and check-up because they need care. Generally, dogs are scared of vet visits because of past traumatising experiences. Does your dog growl, snarl or try to bite during a vet visit? We'll teach you how to change such behaviour, make them enjoy vet visits and keep everyone safe.</p><p>Dog vaccines are essential to prevent diseases that are common among dogs. Vaccination strengthens the immune system and keeps your canine protected. Study the core vaccines for dogs and the diseases they help to prevent. Investigate the right amount of calories they need to consume daily, what diet is suitable and how to supplement the diet for a healthy coat. Furthermore, we'll explore various sources of food and how they impact dogs' health. Dog populations can quickly increase, leading to unwanted pets and overcrowded shelters and rescues. A solution for this is to neuter dogs. Gain insights into what neutering entails and its benefits.</p><p>The anatomy of dogs encompasses the structural organisation of the external or visible part of dogs' bodies. We will analyse their visual features and anatomical terminologies. Breeds differ in size, length, capability, strength and tenacity. How do you know if a dog will suit your family or personal use? The first step is to review the job that a dog is bred to do. We outline the characteristics of the various species of dogs in each group. This knowledge will help you if you're on the verge of getting a dog. We have designed this course for those who want to learn about dog breeds and their anatomy or want to build a career in dog care. Sign up for this course if you're going to own a dog or wish to know more about your four-legged friend.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
