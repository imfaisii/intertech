This course introduces you to various types of AEDs and demonstrates how to use them to improve the odds of survival in cases of cardiac arrest. The National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom operates a procurement and logistics service called the ‘NHS Supply Chain’. This organisation provides a variety of goods and services, including AEDs, to NHS sites like hospitals, clinics and healthcare facilities. We go through the process of purchasing an AED through the NHS Supply Chain and describe the proper installation of the device at a suitable location. We explain how to perform defibrillation, which can save lives during a cardiac arrest, and how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to increase its effectiveness.</p><p>It is important to follow proper safety precautions when using an AED to ensure that the device is used effectively and that the safety of the patient, paramedics and bystanders is not compromised. We lay out the necessary safety measures to take when using an AED in various situations. We also identify the objects and substances that must be removed prior to using the AED to protect the patient's safety. The goal of installing an AED in the workplace is to protect both employees and the general public. This course describes the advantages of placing AEDs in workplaces and educational institutions and explores the UK government's recommendations concerning the practice. Regular maintenance of AEDs is important because it ensures that the device will be in good working order and ready to use in an emergency. We show you how to maintain an AED and discuss when to replace it and the medical protocols to follow to ensure safe usage.</p><p>This course has been designed for health and safety officers and aspiring paramedics but also suits anyone who provides first-aid in the UK. They must meet updated AED training requirements from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). This course has no prerequisites and enhances your CV by teaching you valuable skills and knowledge about CPR and AEDs. We present appropriate illustrations and diagrams to clarify the course material and help you acquire practical skills. Learning how to operate an AED is important for everyone because it can save the lives of people around you and this course can open doors for you as an AED operator in various organisations and settings.
