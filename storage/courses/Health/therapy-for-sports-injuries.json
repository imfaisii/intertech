Sporting activities can also injure internal organs so it is critical to treat injuries fast. This course will teach you the underlying principles of therapy for sports injuries. It begins with answering some basic questions. What is a sports injury? What are the common sports injuries? We will outline human anatomy and explore the duties of a sports therapist. A professional therapist must know how to assess the damage before planning a therapy session. The professional associations for sports therapy have specific responsibilities as they are the torchbearers of ethical standards. Understand these aspects and learn the types of injuries that vary across different sports. Investigate the ten types of common injuries and which kind of injury a first aider can treat quickly.</p><p>The next module dives deeper into more significant injuries in sports. A sports first aider can expect to encounter head, neck or back injuries during an event. There can also be fractures, dislocations or damage to the internal organs. What will you do if the patient is in a life-threatening condition or unresponsive? What should be the next step if a sportsperson is bleeding profusely or has difficulty breathing? You will learn to manage such injuries and follow the step-by-step recovery plan. Physical fitness depends upon nutrition and a sports therapist must know the nutrients in a diet and the toxins in food. The sports nutrition principles will emphasise the relationship between people and their food while highlighting the factors that affect their dietary habits.</p><p>Finally, you will study different rehabilitation exercises and therapies. Any rehabilitation plan aims to help increase the stability, strength and power for achieving a whole fitness level. The sections on mobility, strength training, static stretching and other exercises will give you the confidence to practice what you learn. The massage therapy treatment strategy will share ideas for safe and effective massage treatments, including hydrotherapy and electrotherapy. As a sports therapist, you will have the skill to rehabilitate an athlete and return them to full fitness. Sports injury clinics employ therapists. You can even be associated with a sports club or as a self-employed professional. There is sufficient scope for development in this field as sports and fitness will always be sought after by young and old.
