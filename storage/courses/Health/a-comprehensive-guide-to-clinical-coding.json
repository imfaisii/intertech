Clinical coders are responsible for documenting this information and the practice of doing that is called clinical coding. Clinical coding enables a smooth medical record transfer between different healthcare providers. This course will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of clinical coding, including important principles, strategies for using it and in-depth expertise. We begin with fundamental clinical coding knowledge and eventually move up to expert knowledge. You’ll learn to differentiate the concept of coding from billing. You’ll understand the key roles in clinical coding as well as the factors that cause coding errors. In addition, you’ll learn about clinical records, their importance and their principles. You'll also study some useful medical terms which are essential for medical coders and billers.&nbsp;</p><p>The ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) is a classification and coding system used by healthcare providers to classify and code all diagnoses, symptoms and procedures recorded in conjunction with hospital care. Clinical coders must possess an accurate understanding of ICD-10. In this course, you’ll be introduced to the concept of ICD-10 and the importance of clinical auditing codes including the rules for selecting accurate codes. You will learn about the title of the identifiers for general coding standards and the process of applying the identifiers for coding. You’ll explore how to identify the general coding standards that are used for ICD-10 including how to apply the ICD-10 codes in the clinical record. We discuss some of the infectious and parasitic diseases, blood and endocrine diseases and their codes. Following that, we examine the various types of neoplasms and their codes.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, we’ll dive deeper into the ICD-10 codes and examine the clinical coding for mental and behavioural disorders and nervous system diseases. You’ll study the diseases of the digestive system, diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue and their codes. You will learn the various ways of coding with accuracy as well as the identifiers for OPCS-4 and the way of applying the identifiers. On top of that, we cover the basic concepts of SNOMED CT and also discuss why SNOMED CT should be used in clinical coding. The course rounds up by highlighting other types of clinical coding such as CPT and HCPCS level coding. This course is a well-paced course developed by clinical experts and is designed for clinical coders, clinical coding officers, medical coders and anyone interested in clinical coding. As the need for healthcare services grows, so does the demand for experienced clinical coding experts. So, what are you waiting for?
