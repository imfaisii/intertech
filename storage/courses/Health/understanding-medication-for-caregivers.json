However, most caregivers do not feel prepared to handle their prescription, which can be a source of anxiety. In addition, a caregiver must understand the symptoms, possible allergies and potential side effects of drug interactions, especially for the elderly and dependent adults. This course can be used as a reference guide as it provides general definitions and information about medications.</p><p>We will reveal four tips that you should keep in mind to help you provide safe and effective care, which is your number one priority. First, we will explore the different and most effective ways of administering medication. Next, you will examine and study various oral drugs (including capsules, tablets, granules and liquids) and how to manage them. Then we review the classification of time-released (TR) tablets, including the long-acting (LA) and short-acting (SA) varieties. We will highlight six crucial facts about medication metabolism.</p><p>Furthermore, we will study how age and diseases affect medication metabolism. Understand how you take some medications orally, yet they are not metabolised in the digestive system. Investigate the methods for administering medication to people who have difficulty swallowing before learning the differences between side effects and allergic reactions. Finally, we provide you with some practical approaches to safely keeping track of your loved one or client’s medications. This course will teach you to confidently administer safe and adequate care for your clients and loved ones.
