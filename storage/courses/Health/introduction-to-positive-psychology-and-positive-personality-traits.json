The course then lays out Abraham Maslow’s famous ‘hierarchy of needs’ and goes through his ‘eight positive personality traits of self-actualizing people’.</p><p>Finally, we investigate how to develop character strengths and virtues and establish why this is important. We demonstrate the importance of character strengths in our daily lives and lay out the different classification of such strengths and virtues according to the doctrine of positive psychology. This course can help you understand the models of character strength and even develop your own.
