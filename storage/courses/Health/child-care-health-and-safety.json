This course explores children's physical, cognitive, emotional and social development and the natural and environmental factors responsible for child development. Children need care and attention from adults to grow, develop self-esteem and have a good self-image. Discover the importance of touch and managing necessary routine activities such as eating, clothing and sleeping for children. Some children are born with physical and mental issues that impact their body, brain, speaking and learning abilities. Such children have special needs and require extra care and support to live healthy and comfortable lives. You will learn how to identify the special needs of children, take care of those with physical and cognitive impairments and use the correct descriptive terms to avoid stereotyping and prejudice against such individuals.</p><p>Do you know that the best time in life to establish good eating habits is during childhood? Establishing a good eating habit early on provides the correct amounts and nutrients needed to maintain good health throughout your lifetime. We will research which food supplies the essential nutrients for a healthy body and mind. Cleanliness and personal safety and hygiene are necessary for remaining healthy. You must train children to follow your routines until they can achieve this alone. You will learn to identify and handle illnesses and protect children from hazards. Investigate the different forms of child abuse, its harmful effects and ways to help children protect themselves against abuse. Play is not only about having fun – it is a great way to learn and explore the world for children. We will demonstrate the importance of play and creativity in a child's cognitive, social and emotional development.</p><p>We have designed this course for parents with babies and young children and people working in child care and protection. It also serves as a starting point in understanding the complexity of raising a child. This course offers lectures with clear and straightforward explanations of issues faced by caregivers along with their solutions. The busy lifestyle of the modern world forces parents to work extra hours to make ends meet, leaving little time for their families. This opens up job prospects for child care professionals. Grab this opportunity to equip yourself with the knowledge and understanding of raising a child in a safe and healthy environment.
