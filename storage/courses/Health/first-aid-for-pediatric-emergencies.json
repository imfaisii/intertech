Its primary aim is to equip you with the necessary knowledge of pediatric emergencies so that they deescalate a hazardous incident. In addition, this course contains the methods of responding to choking, asthma, food poisoning, animal bites and fall injuries and discusses some basic aspects of pediatric medicine.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>When expecting a child, a parent's primary preoccupation is ensuring that their baby will be born healthy and without complications. While this is true for most children born today, pediatric accidents in the home can occur, which can cause fatal consequences if you do not take appropriate steps to combat these mishaps. Therefore as a parent, teacher or guardian, you must be fully aware of common pediatric emergencies and how to handle them efficiently. Consequently, we have designed this comprehensive course to help adults manage some of the most prevalent hazards in the home and school settings.</p><p>The first two topics in this course stress the importance of pediatric medicine and explain the seven classifications of this age group, along with the significant differences between adult medicine and pediatric medicine. The four critical milestones in a child's health are also included for parents to understand what a pediatrician will look for while examining their child. The course also contains two essential video tutorials that will teach you to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on an infant and help protect a choking child.</p><p>We then illustrate the most commonly occurring pediatric emergencies. These include falls, injuries, cut and puncture wounds, animal bites, insect stings and electrocution, emphasising three common childhood hazards: asthma, choking and food poisoning. We will equip parents or guardians to provide medical care for their children by exploring these emergencies. While all advice in this course comes from authentic sources, you should not consider it an alternative to expert medical advice. Instead, this course will guide you through these potential emergencies to be best prepared to look after the children in your care.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
