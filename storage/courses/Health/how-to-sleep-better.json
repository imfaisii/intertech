This course is here to help you learn the answer to this very important, frequently asked question. It will cover every important habit that you need to develop in order to have a restful night and solid, uninterrupted sleep. We all have a number of doubts and questions when it comes to insomnia or sleeplessness. What kind of nightly routine should one have for a night of good sleep? Does diet have any role in causing insomnia? How can too much screen time cause sleeplessness? Why do I wake up in the middle of the night? These, and many more questions will be answered as you work through this course including some simple principles and solutions such as the importance of good sleep for your overall well-being, effective bedtime routines and what needs to be avoided in the last hour of the day.</p><p>Many people complain about waking up two to four hours too early and not being able to go back to sleep. This causes fatigue in the long-run. Many others wake up in the middle of the night and then keep tossing and turning in bed. Small details like blocking unwanted sound and light during the night can prevent us from waking up. You will be introduced to certain simple and practical tools to create a restful environment and a bedroom designed for getting a good night’s sleep. How we start our day has an effect on how we sleep at night. So, the next part of course discusses the best practices for morning routines and will help you analyze your own habits and bring the desired changes for improving your sleep quality. The do’s and the don’ts in terms of your diet to ensure good sleep are then discussed which will help you to plan and implement an appropriate lifestyle change to benefit you.</p><p>The final section of this course will teach you about the unique and proprietary Selfie Speak Programming or SSP method, for turning conventional wisdom or conscious facts into unconscious and permanent habits. This in-depth course offers much more than standard advice and you will be able to use the SSP method to achieve a lifetime of restful and uninterrupted sleep even while travelling between different time zones. However, the tools, tips, routines and rituals described in this course may not benefit someone with insomnia due to a medical condition. In such cases, you are advised to consult a medical practitioner. Sleep deficiency can not only leave you with that tired, worn-out feeling but can cause many medical conditions like heart disease, weight gain and prolonged illness. Enrol in this course and learn how to make useful changes in your own routines, encourage others to do the same, and ensure that those necessary six to eight hours of sleep lead to a healthy and productive life.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
