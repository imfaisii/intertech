This represents about 4% of the global population as people face situations that, if not handled properly, can lead to chronic stress and clinical anxiety in the long run. This psychology course teaches you how to manage stress and anxiety and examines various treatments used by professional psychologists to improve their patients’ mental health.</p><p>We begin with simple definitions of ‘stress’ and an examination of its primary causes. We explain that stress is not always harmful to the body and can actually improve your life. The course then lays out the major risk factors associated with stress. A ‘normal’ level of stress can be managed by employing some simple stress management techniques. We study such techniques with the help of various real-life scenarios and practical examples to provide a practical understanding of the psychology behind stress.</p><p>Exercise is essential for maintaining one's physical health but also plays a role in improving our mental health. The course establishes the role of exercise in managing stress and anxiety disorders. We then discuss psychiatric options like drugs and clinical treatments that professionals use to treat severe stress and anxiety. This course suits anyone who is concerned about the impact of stress and anxiety and is interested in using mindfulness techniques to improve their mental health. It also suits professional psychologists and psychiatrists who want to stay current on the most advanced treatment techniques.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
