You can use water for many things, including treating disorders in the body. We regard this as ‘hydrotherapy’ when we treat these body conditions using water. This course explains the science of water and the benefits of hydrotherapy in treating ailments. We demonstrate the difference between hydrotherapy and swimming. Explore the processes by which heat is transferred from one substance to another. You will understand the heat exchange that can occur when hot or cold water is in contact with the body. Do you find yourself wondering why some substances dissolve in water? This course explains why we regard water as a universal solvent.</p><p>First, we must understand how our bodies work to appreciate the benefits of hydrotherapy on the areas of our bodies that have signs of illness. In this light, we review the anatomy and physiology of several body systems that are key to hydrotherapy. You will also learn the body's natural skills at defending itself against possible threats that you can use during a hydrotherapy session. Hydrotherapy treatments substantially affect blood vessels, shifting blood flow from one part of the body to another. We will explore the networking of the circulatory and nervous systems and their role in the body. We will study the systematics of the movement of blood and lymphatic fluids and nerve impulses throughout the body. We will analyse the communication between the nervous and circulatory systems in detail.</p><p>Can hydrotherapy treat all conditions of the body? Why not discover the various types of typical conditions treated using hydrotherapy. You will learn about the symptoms of these conditions, how they affect an individual's body and how you treat them. If you are a pet owner or own any animal, you can use hydrotherapy as a form of treatment for animals. We will investigate the benefits of hydrotherapy for animals, assessment methods and precautions needed before considering it for their use. Following that, we will show you the types of hydrotherapy for animals and the equipment used. We have designed this course for those wanting to understand these methods for treating disorders in humans and animals using water.
