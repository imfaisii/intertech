This leadership course provides the skills required by team leaders as they work to bring out the best in those around them. The course starts with an overview of the elements that make up a team and explains how to develop trust and accountability. We establish the importance of active listening, team culture, values and activities and lay out the stages of the ‘adaptive’ leadership style.</p><p>Leaders and managers must function as role models and a source of inspiration for those around them. They play a key role in defining a team’s organisational culture and ethical approach. Team loyalty and shared commitment will naturally follow from this inspiration and we provide proven techniques that you can use for team building to encourage sustained commitment to excellence. The course then discusses the role of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace. There’s no place for prejudice in medicine so healthcare team leaders need to know how to challenge discrimination and encourage team members to adopt a respectful approach that draws on DEI values and practices.</p><p>The course then discusses the role of morale and motivation in driving performance. We explain how to support and encourage the team's success through creativity and innovation. We show you how to assign roles and responsibilities within a team and implement effective support systems to help your colleagues shine. The course also emphasises the importance of effective goal-setting to team leaders and managers. We demonstrate how ‘specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound’ (‘SMART’) targets provide an excellent way to map and identify personal and team objectives. Our final section teaches you how to identify team performance issues and provide proper feedback. The leadership principles laid out in this course apply in many fields but we have tailored our lessons to apply to medical settings. Sign up to learn how to become an inspirational healthcare team leader and role model who creates an organisational culture of excellence.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
