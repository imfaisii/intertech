Anaphylaxis management and basic life support (BLS) are crucial skills that can mean the difference between life and death. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can lead to unconsciousness and death if not treated immediately. This course will teach you how to recognise and treat it, as well as how to provide basic life support in an emergency situation in order to potentially save a person's life. You will learn about the causes, triggers and symptoms of anaphylaxis, as well as how to identify individuals who are at risk. You will explore how to use adrenaline auto-injectors to treat anaphylactic reactions and how allergens play a role in attacks. Following that, we’ll teach you how to avoid or reduce exposure to allergens that can cause anaphylaxis including the role of medications and how to use them correctly.</p><p>It is important that individuals who have experienced an anaphylactic reaction have a follow-up plan in place to prevent or manage future reactions. We'll show you how anaphylaxis can be managed on an individual level as well as how to reduce the risk of allergic reactions in school and prevent anaphylactic shock in the workplace. Anaphylaxis isn't the only emergency you need to be prepared for.

We’ll provide you with insights into the importance of early recognition and intervention in life-threatening emergencies including the role of the BLS provider in the emergency care system. You'll learn about the various approaches to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and how to prioritise interventions based on the patient's needs.</p><p>Next, you'll learn about the role of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in the management of cardiac arrest and learn how to use an AED properly. We'll help you understand the importance of early defibrillation in the management of cardiac arrest and the role of the BLS provider in facilitating timely defibrillation. We also cover choking complications in adults and children including how to treat them. Lastly, you will learn how to properly position a person in recovery, including first aid techniques for emergency situations. This course is an important investment in your personal and professional growth because it will provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to recognise and manage anaphylaxis.
