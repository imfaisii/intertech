As new diseases emerge, doctors and researchers strive to establish preventive measures and remedies for these new disorders or illnesses. One of the treatment methods developed in the early times by physicians and researchers to cure ailments is homoeopathy. Homoeopathy is a therapy method created in the early days of medicine to combat several conditions. Homoeopathic practitioners use two concepts or theories that early physicians devised to cure disorders and diseases. This course will show you the concepts and principles of homoeopathic treatment and the treatment remedies for ailments and diseases. We begin by discussing the history of homoeopathic treatment, the early physicians and researchers involved in developing this treatment method and their theories.</p><p>Our bodies are made up of various biological systems that perform specialized functions required for daily life. Before you may use a homoeopathic therapy approach to address diseases, you'll need to have a fundamental understanding of anatomy, physiology and body function. We explore how the circulatory system works and discuss how our bodies distribute nutrients to various parts via this system. Upon that, you will gain insight into how the digestive system breaks down food substances in the body and how the musculoskeletal system works. You will explore common circulatory, musculoskeletal and other systemic problems in the human body. Then you will investigate the homoeopathic therapy solutions to those problems. Homoeopathic remedies are substances derived from plant, mineral and animal sources. How are these substances prepared and in what quantities? This material covers the principles and step-by-step processes required to make homoeopathic therapeutic medicines.</p><p>The course will then look at our largest organ: the skin. The skin is a flexible layer of tissue that aids and assists body functions. The skin serves various purposes and, quite simply, contributes significantly to our physical attractiveness. Consider how a skinless human would appear! Most of us would be horrified. We outline all the skin functions, skin issues and homoeopathic therapy methods for skin problems. Finally, we will discuss the benefits of homoeopathic therapy methods and why individuals choose them over conventional treatment methods. No prior knowledge is needed to take this course. But, if you are curious about homoeopathy and would like to learn how to produce homoeopathic remedies and use homoeopathic therapy to cure several ailments, this course is for you.
