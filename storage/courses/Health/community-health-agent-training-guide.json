However, having sophisticated hospitals and highly trained staff is not always the most efficient way of improving health. Community health workers (CHWs) are a priceless addition to any healthcare system. They serve to bridge the gap between the population and the healthcare services they need. The CHWs extend health services to places where people live and work, support communities in identifying their health needs and help people solve their health problems. Are you interested in helping your community have a better and healthier life? In this course, we will assist you in finding your niche as a public health worker and teach you how to deal with the health problems of individuals and the community while working in close relationships with health service providers.</p><p>A community health worker brings essential services to the community, providing maternity support, first aid, health education, advocacy, informal counselling for addiction and many more. They may work as volunteers or paid aides for government-run programs, not-for-profit organisations or health care agencies. You will learn about the core competencies a CHW must have to become successful. We will guide you through identifying community health problem(s) like protein deficiencies, substance abuse, mental health and disabilities. You will understand how to plan programmes that will aid in overcoming these challenges. Discover how improved communication between communities and CHWs can help reduce racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare and build a trustworthy relationship. We will also apprise you of the legal issues like human rights, the right to consent and data protection related to this profession.</p><p>If you are considering a career as a community health worker, this is a great place to start. If you work in a Ministry of Health or support a community health programme, we will help you advance your knowledge and skills to deliver quality care. The community health worker is an umbrella term. It includes a range of community health aides like community health representatives (CHR), community health advisors, health coaches, family advocates, health educators, liaisons, outreach workers, patient navigators, public health aides and more. So you typically have plenty of prospects for movement within the profession. This course will also help you explore the different roles of a community health worker and what suits you best. So why wait? Take this opportunity and start improving the health and wellbeing of your community.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4940\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
