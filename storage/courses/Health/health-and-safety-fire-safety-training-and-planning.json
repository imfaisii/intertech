Fire safety programmes need to be developed and regulated under the auspices of each authority's health and safety standards. This course intends to help you establish and maintain a safe working environment. It will guide you through preventative measures to minimise the causes of fires and teach you correct evacuation procedures if one occurs.&nbsp;</p><p>We believe that knowledge and education is crucial to save lives and prevent property damage. This training course begins by explaining the components of a fire and the possible causes. Then you will investigate how to prevent fires before learning how to reduce them, inspect potential problems and report them as soon as they occur. This leads to the necessity of a fire prevention plan (FPP), which provides information and guidelines to all employees or trainees to control fires or eliminate their cause in the first place.</p><p>The second section of the course will teach you emergency evacuation and procedures. You will become familiar with portable and stationary equipment and learn how to plan ahead if a fire breaks out. Understand that at least two evacuation routes are required in an evacuation plan and know that you should display these emergency routes in a visible location. Individuals requiring assistance must particularly be prepared and know their routes. The course will take you step by step through emergency procedures and train you in simple fire safety techniques. Although this material is a health and safety guide, individuals should refer to specific requirements and practices based on their industry and location. So enrol today and be a step ahead of your colleagues in understanding fire safety and the role that evacuation procedures can play in keeping everyone safe.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4651\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
