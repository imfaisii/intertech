This course introduces you to the duties of counsellors and lays out the principles used in psychological counselling. We then examine UK legislation related to mental health that provides the framework that safeguards the rights of people suffering from psychiatric issues. We also outline the code of ethics governing professional counsellors. Children and adolescents are more likely than adults to suffer from certain mental health issues that impact their development and routine life activities. We study these problems and explain how to treat them. All personalities contain negative traits but people with personality disorders display negative traits in extreme and unhealthy ways. We explore the causes and symptoms of such personality disorders and lay out the counselling practices used to treat such mental ailments before moving on to substance abuse, anxiety and stress.</p><p>Depression is a long-lasting low mood that can occur for a variety of reasons. We investigate the causes and symptoms of depression and related mood disorders and provide the appropriate counselling techniques to address them. We then go through the causes and symptoms of sleeping and eating disorders before describing treatment options. The course then discusses the role of career counsellors in helping clients make informed professional decisions. In similar vein, we describe how couple counselling can help clients understand the dynamics of their relationship through effective communication and collaboration. We explore the scope and techniques of couple and family counselling to help your clients resolve their disputes. We demonstrate how to help clients develop coping skills to deal with immediate crises like the loss of a loved one, divorce and relocation.</p><p>We designed this course for people who want to pursue a career in counselling. This course is also useful for professional counsellors who want to improve their knowledge and expertise in counselling to provide more effective input. There is no prerequisite knowledge or experience required to take this course and anyone interested in understanding and treating mental disorders can take the course. The instructor explains both the theoretical and practical portions of counselling. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), anxiety and depression have significantly increased since the Covid-19 pandemic. This emphasises the need for more mental health practitioners and counsellors so there are job opportunities for people with the right skills. Sign up to become one of them and learn how to turn your talent for listening and giving advice into a rewarding career as a counsellor.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
