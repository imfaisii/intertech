Does it worry you? This child psychology course examines the role that imaginary friends can play in positively impacting childhood development and fostering creativity. We begin by defining the term ‘imaginary friend’ and identifying the usual age bracket during which a child may invent one. The course then provides a brief history and description of the common characteristics of these imaginary friends.</p><p>Having an imaginary friend can not only have a positive impact on your child’s development but is also linked to increased creativity during adulthood. We lay out the benefits of such connections and explain how parents can actually play an encouraging role in this aspect of their children’s lives through creative activities that help children develop their imagination and creativity. Rather than worrying about imaginary friends, parents can join in the fun and actually boost childhood development.</p><p>The course&nbsp; goes over some useful techniques that can be used by parents and teachers alike to keep children busy and engaged while they make the most of their creativity. Imagination is one of the most important tools for children and parents or teachers must cultivate this quality from an early age. Sign up for this child psychology course to see how an imaginary friend or companion can be a positive sign for children as they develop and learn how to make the most of such ‘friendships’ to cultivate your child’s curiosity, creativity and sense of wonder.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
