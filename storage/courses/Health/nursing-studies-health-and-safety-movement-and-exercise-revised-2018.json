You will study body mechanics so you can utilise the correct muscles to complete a task safely and efficiently. You will also learn about the most common injuries sustained by nurses as well as the importance of changing the patient's position. This course will then look into the general principles that apply when turning the adult patient. It will also discuss the common positions and techniques used when helping a patient to walk.<br><br>You will then study the active and passive ranges of motion in exercise. You will learn that a joint that has not been moved sufficiently can begin to stiffen within 24 hours and will eventually become inflexible, which is why a nurse has to perform Range of Motion (ROM) exercises on each joint in as full a range as possible without causing pain. You will also look into isometric exercises and the different types of body movements.<br><br>Learning the principles of good body mechanics and the different techniques for positioning patients will ensure that both the nurse and patient are kept safe from accidents. This course will give you an in-depth understanding of these movements and even teach you what to do if a patient begins to fall. So if you are looking into a career as a nurse practitioner or just want to refresh your knowledge on the proper body movements and exercises, take this course and help bring your patients back to their feet.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/1360\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
