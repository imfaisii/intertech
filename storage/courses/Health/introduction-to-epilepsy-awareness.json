Recurrent, inexplicable convulsions are a prominent symptom of epilepsy. However, this ailment cannot be diagnosed after just one seizure. This epilepsy awareness course provides a foundational understanding of this neurological disorder. We begin by teaching you its classification, treatment issues and aetiology. This includes discussion of the causes of epilepsy, including head injuries, brain tumours and cerebrovascular disease.</p><p>The course’s following section focuses on seizures. We review their classifications and delve into the specific acute management of seizures in people with intellectual disabilities. We also study the differential diagnosis of epilepsy, syncope, sleep disorders, migraines and so on. The course explains how to manage newly diagnosed epilepsy, chronic active epilepsy and epilepsy in different groups of ages. You show you how to identify the specific instances where antiepileptic medications should be used.</p><p>Epilepsy is often accompanied by cognitive, psychological and behavioural changes. In this course’s final section, we explore the connection between epilepsy and behaviour and describe the associated risks of epilepsy, seizure control methods, safety aids and the phenomenon of ‘Sudden Unexpected Deaths in Epilepsy’ (SUDEP). Janets UK designed this course to raise awareness about epilepsy and provide the healthcare training you need to keep people safe.
