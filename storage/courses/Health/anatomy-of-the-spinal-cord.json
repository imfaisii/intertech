The spinal cord is one of the essential parts of the human body. A clear understanding of its anatomy is vital if you want to comprehend the functions of other areas of the body. Your tutor, Dr Saqib Mansoor, will help you understand this crucial body part in depth. The course kicks off by introducing you to the spinal cord. We describe key features and functions of the spinal cord within the structure of the human body. You will examine the various nerves attached to the spinal cord and their roots and explore the cells and nuclei that form the spinal nerves.</p><p>How do nerves react within seconds to make our body parts move? The human brain and spinal cord are connected through a complex system of nerves and fibres that transmit signals within milliseconds to help the body perform different functions. These nerves are crucial to ensure the proper functioning of other body parts. We will investigate these nerves, their roots and their connections to different body sections. We explore the nuclear connections between motor and sensory neurons, the relationship between nerves and other key central nervous system components and their structures and connections. Each section is demonstrated using videos and diagrams to help you grasp the key concepts. Dr Saqib Mansoor will also guide you through each term to ensure that they become crystal clear.</p><p>The course will take you through the composition of the spinal cord, the matter and cells that make up the spinal cord and their location. We use diagrams of the white and grey matter that form the internal structure of the nervous system. Each nerve within the spinal cord structure is responsible for different body part movements. In addition, we investigate various symptoms and signs shown by patients when damage is done to particular spinal cord parts. The spinal cord connection to the brain and multiple nerves provide critical motoric and sensory signals that ensure that we function properly in our day-to-day lives.
