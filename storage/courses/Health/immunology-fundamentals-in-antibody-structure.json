You will learn about the composition of protein chains in immunoglobulin molecules and the structure of the immunoglobulin constant and variable domains. This course is arranged systematically and presented clearly so you will easily be able to understand the concepts discussed.</p><p>Next, the material will explain the process of determining the specificity for an antigen, based on the variation in the sequences of the antibody V domains. It then demonstrates the relationships between a light-chain variable region’s antigen-binding site, its domain structure, and the gene that encodes it. The course emphasizes the recombination signal sequences (RSS) that flank the gene segments by encoding the V, D, and J regions of immunoglobulins.</p><p>Finally, you will learn about the enzymatic steps involved in the V-region rearrangement of gene segments. The contribution to the diversity of the third hypervariable region based on the variable addition and subtraction of nucleotides at the junctions between gene segments is also discussed. This course, ‘Immunology - Fundamentals in Antibody Structure’, is an informative study guide which will interest students studying biotechnology, life sciences and genetic engineering.
