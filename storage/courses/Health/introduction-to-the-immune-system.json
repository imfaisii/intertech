You will learn about the components of the immune system that play a significant role in both innate as well as adaptive immunity, and how the immune system defends the body against the threat of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms that can cause disease). This course is arranged systematically and presented clearly so you will easily be able to understand the given concepts.</p><p>Next, the material will explain the process of capturing antigens and how adaptive immune responses are initiated by the antigen-presenting cells in the lymphoid tissues such as white blood cells, bone marrow and the spleen. The course then demonstrates the proliferation of lymphocytes in the peripheral lymphoid organs for generating effector cells and immunological memory. It emphasizes the role of T-cells in orchestrating cell-mediated immunity and regulating the responses of B-cells to antigens.</p><p>Finally, you will learn about the significance of the adaptive immune response for the control of allergies, autoimmune disease, and the rejection of transplanted organs. The role of the immune system in defending against the dangers presented by pathogens is also discussed. ‘An Introduction to the Immune System’ is an informative course that will interest students studying life sciences, biotechnology and genetic engineering or those who have an interest in these topics.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
