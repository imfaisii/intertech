In this comprehensive course, you will learn about the procedure for recognizing foreign pathogens in the body and the maturation and activation process of T- and B-cells. The material is arranged systematically and presented clearly so you will easily be able to understand the given concepts.</p><p>Next, the course will explain the process of mediating the inflammatory response through the migration of neutrophils (the most common type of granulocytes that make up the majority of white blood cells in humans) to the site of action. It then demonstrates the differentiation process of the B-cells into plasma B-cells for producing antibodies to deal with antigens from pathogens. The course emphasizes the role of antigen-presenting cells as a connector between the adaptive and innate immune systems.</p><p>Finally, you will learn about the mediation of the humoral immune response to fight against antigens. The primary functions of the antibodies and the role of effector molecules in destroying the pathogens are also discussed. ‘Understanding Inflammation’ is an informative course that will benefit students studying - or young professionals starting out in - life sciences, biotechnology and genetic engineering.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
