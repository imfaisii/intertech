Youngsters display a keen level of curiosity and exhibit rapid growth and development. Children are the leaders of tomorrow so their optimal growth, development and wellbeing are essential. The quality of care and interactions children experience with their parents or a care provider can shape how they think, feel, act and interact with others. This experience stays with them for a lifetime and can affect their speech development and social behaviour. Who better than a qualified nursery nurse to provide the care that a child needs? This course is for you if you have a soft spot for children and have thought about working in a childcare setting. We will show you the day-to-day tasks of a nursery nurse and explain how they can support children's learning, development and emotional and social needs.</p><p>Being a good and successful nursery nurse requires having the necessary attributes to provide exceptional care to children. Discover the characteristics that will help you supply quality care and support to children. Gain insight into their growth, developmental process and skills they may develop. We explore the basic principles of a person's 'right from birth', the techniques for observing children and these various types of observation. Study the early childhood curriculum frameworks used in providing learning experiences for them. Despite the diverse nature of children, discrimination against them can also be highly impactful in their lives. Equality is necessary to maintain fairness, exercise their rights, access opportunities and so on. You'll gain insight into the concept of equality, diversity, inclusion and discrimination and how they can affect a child's life.</p><p>Children can experience neglect in particular aspects of their lives, negatively affecting their social behaviour, thoughts and feelings. We'll examine the signs of child neglect, the many types of abuse and how to help children protect themselves. Maintaining proper personal hygiene is one of the most effective strategies to guard against infectious diseases. We will study children's hygiene and the importance of sustaining good personal hygiene. After that, we'll analyse how to protect children from accidents and hazards, the importance of a balanced diet and the significance of play. The last section of this course discusses the concept of special needs and how to develop partnerships with children's parents. No prior knowledge is needed to begin this course as we have designed it for all learners. A career as a nursery nurse can be beneficial if you enjoy spending time with children.
