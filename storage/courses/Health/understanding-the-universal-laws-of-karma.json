Similarly, our spiritual development depends on our adherence to all the universal laws of karma. Strengthening the link to our spiritual side is a skill like any other and this course is designed to help you realise your full potential as a spiritual being as you work to become one with the light of the universe, which our soul represents. This spiritual healing course will explore the esoteric, hidden side of karma by drawing on the teachings of healers, mystics, sages, prophets and medical professionals.</p><p>The course begins with a comparison of human and spiritual karmic laws as we explore various aspects of karma, which emphasises the cause-and-effect impact of our actions. We provide the tools required to triumph over your internal conflict. The course delves into theories of life after death, reincarnation and choosing your life before birth, drawing on various holy Buddhist and Hindu scriptures. We also contrast fate-related suffering and misery borne of free will to explain why we can't remember our past lives. The course then explains how to use forgiveness to overcome your past and develop your spirituality.</p><p>We then demonstrate a simple yet effective deep-breathing technique, followed by a special guided meditation on karma set to soothing music. The course also provides a straightforward yet potent energy-healing approach that you and your clients may use to promote wellbeing.
