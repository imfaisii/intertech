Our bodies are home to a variety of organisms that, in most cases, are beneficial or even safe. But certain microbes have the potential to cause disease in specific situations. For example, some infectious diseases can spread from person to person, animals or insects to humans, by consuming tainted food and water or coming into contact with environmental organisms.&nbsp;</p><p>This course introduces you to pathogens, defines them and explains how they are transmitted. We then explore how an epidemic begins and spreads. Next, we discuss an infection prevention and control program (IPCP) and what is required to develop one. We guide you through the risk identification process and assessment, examples of which you can download from the resource section. Then, you will become familiar with the various hierarchy of controls (HOC) models created to tackle hazardous circumstances and risky work practices.</p><p>Finally, we study health protection procedures and safe work practices. We examine infectious diseases' impact on our health, delving into various pathogens in more detail by looking at their symptoms, their means of transmission and their prevention. This course has no registration or subscriptions fees and optional certification is available on completion.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
