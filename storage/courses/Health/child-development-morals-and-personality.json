We also establish the importance of scruples and altruism and lay out various critical theories of moral development. We explain in depth how moral development follows a recognised sequence and develops simultaneously with cognitive development. We examine Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development and investigate the impact of a child’s environment on their behaviour. We then compare it to Carol Gilligan's emphasis on compassion and love in shaping young minds.</p><p>This course explores the moral aspect of the development of personality and character. We trace the connection between innate characteristics like self-awareness, self-control and self-consciousness that shape someone’s personality. We study Abraham Maslow’s self-actualisation theory of personality in detail. The course then delves into various stages of early childhood development, beginning with the ‘anal’ and ‘oral’ periods. We then examine the ‘latent’ period, during which children are most interested in learning, before moving on to the ‘genital’ period. We show you how sexual maturation affects childhood behavior.</p><p>Our next section focuses on the biological development of organs, tissues and hormones in children as they reach sexual maturity. We discuss how sexual feelings, beliefs and behaviours are determined to be ‘appropriate’ for a certain age. We compare the behaviorist and cognitive perspectives of sexual development to explain the concept of gender identity as and cover the emotional, physical and social aspects of a child’s sexual development. This psychology course is ideal for parents, preschool teachers or psychologists who want to develop their understanding of the early development of personality. Sign up to compare different models used to understand how the foundations for adult morality are laid in childhood and pick up practical tips that guide children towards better decisions.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5204\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
