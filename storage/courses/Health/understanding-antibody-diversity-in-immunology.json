You will learn how the CD4 and CD8 cell-surface proteins of T-cells directly contact the MHC molecules to make an effective response to the antigen. Further, the process of generating peptides from the ubiquitinated proteins and the cessation of antigen processing are also discussed.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Be introduced to the properties of human immunoglobulin isotypes antigen recognition by T-cell receptors. You will learn how the IgM and IgD immunoglobulins are derived from the same pre-mRNA transcript and expressed on the surface of mature B-cells. This complex material is arranged systematically and presented clearly so you will easily be able to understand the given concepts.</p><p>Next, it will explain the process of isotype switching and the different types of variation between immunoglobulins. The course then demonstrates the role of peptides binding and stabilizing the MHC molecule on the cell surface and the creation of new alleles, by copying sequences from one MHC gene to another. It emphasizes the direct binding of the superantigens to the T-cell receptors and MHC molecules.</p><p>Finally, you will learn about the process of generating peptides from the ubiquitinated proteins. The cessation of antigen processing in dendritic cells through the reduced expression of the MARCH-1 E3 ligase is also discussed. ‘Understanding Antibody Diversity in Immunology’ is an informative course that will interest students studying life sciences, genetic engineering and biotechnology.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
