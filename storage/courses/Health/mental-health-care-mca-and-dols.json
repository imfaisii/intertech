This course delves deeply into the Mental Capacity Act, the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards and the fundamental concepts and obligations of public bodies and services created by the Act.</p><p>We begin with an introduction to the mental capacity legislation, the relevant code of practices and its core principles. You will learn what 'best interests' decisions are, how to make them and how to handle a dispute. You will also study the role of independent mental capacity advocates and lasting powers of attorney before reviewing how the MCA relates to social and health care. We will also outline the roles and responsibilities of the court of protection, the deputies appointed by the court and the public guardian.</p><p>The last section deals with the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) and the MCA's guidelines on the subject. Discover the assessment procedures, timescales and standard processes utilised to assess a DoLS authorisation request. You will also examine the application of the MCA and DoLS during a pandemic and the powers held by various bodies and officials. Finally, you will discover the liberty protection safeguards, their essential requirements and how they vary from DoLS. John Academy is the publisher of this course. They provide learners with easy-to-understand study materials. Anybody who works in the mental health care sector and wants to learn more about MCA and DoLS will find this course beneficial.
