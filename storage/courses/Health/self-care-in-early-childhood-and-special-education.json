They have a good psychological state of mind and are generally more productive than those deprived of primary care. This course will teach you the basic caregiving measures. İlbey UÇAR, who has a Master's degree in Psychology and continues his Doctoral education in Sports Psychology for the Disabled, is your publisher. He is the founder of the PsyNomad company and has served many domestic and foreign clients in Turkey. As he became more aware of the value of sharing and accessing knowledge during the pandemic, he began designing and producing courses that students in his field could reach, regardless of economic level.</p><p>We begin the course by describing the process of appropriately cleaning an infant's body and explain how this helps their wellbeing. Next, we explore the gymnastic movements suitable for children aged 0 to 1. You will also discover the nutritional needs of infants and the contribution various nutrients play in the growth of a healthy child. We will then review the different tips and suggestions to train toddlers to care for their personal needs.</p><p>Children with special needs require additional attention. Dealing with such children involves a lot more effort. The final section of the course will therefore focus solely on training you to provide adequate care to meet the needs of these children. Learn to feed, dress and teach them to grow and help themselves. This course is suitable for individuals who have just become parents, professional caregivers who support families and people who want to take up the caregiving profession for special needs children.
