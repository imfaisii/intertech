Following that, we discuss the differences between children with autism and those with normal development. We then explore the epidemiology of ASD and the different diagnostic criteria for spectrum disorders. Learning how to deal with the critical sensory problems children experience with autism disorder is discussed in detail. Next, learn about the body and object use skills of children with ASD compared to normal development.</p><p>The course explains various education methods for children with autism using different strategies. Study educational programs related to the behaviour modification model and discuss basic learning readiness skills for children's development. How to teach autistic children to speak in order to develop their vocabulary is also covered. Then, learn about the behaviour problems in autistic children that cause them difficulty. Following this, explore some models, methods, and theories that benefit preschoolers with autism. Next, examine symptoms of gastrointestinal problems in autism spectrum disorder. Children with ASD also face a lot of nutritional problems and we will discuss how to deal with these through a proper diet plan.</p><p>Then, we will explore nutritional behaviour associated with the disorder and deficiencies in micronutrients, such as calcium, magnesium, and B12. In addition, we will discuss how heavy metals aid stress reduction in autistic children. Then explore benefits of the Mediterranean diet as well as gluten-free (or casein-free), low-carb and ketogenic diets, and see how to do an elimination diet for allergies to certain foods. This course is ideal for parents, special education teachers or preschool educators to develop their knowledge of ASD in early childhood.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5238\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
