As a result, mental health has become an important concern for healthcare systems around the world. This course teaches the knowledge needed to examine IPV cases, deal with IPV victims and alleviate actions and habits that may endanger victims' health.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>According to recent research, one in every four women worldwide will experience intimate partner violence (IPV) during her lifetime. Such victims frequently present with many related mental and physical health issues. We begin this course by discussing the current definition of IPV, which includes violence between same-sex and different-sex partners. Following that, you will learn about the behaviors that commonly comprise IPV, as well as the mental and physical health issues that frequently accompany it. Investigate the basic underlying theories of this behavior and why many abused individuals never formally seek help from IPV resources.</p><p>Because research shows that violent behavior tends to escalate over time, we will teach you how to recognize its warning signs, including potential indicators between same-sex partners and the risk factors for IPV development and maintenance. This course will provide health professionals with essential theory and evidence-based assessment and intervention strategies, as well as specialized health and legal resources for individuals in abusive relationships, in an effort to reduce the burden of IPV.</p><p>Finally, because relationship abuse can be culturally specific, techniques for increasing cultural competence while working with IPV victims are emphasized throughout the course. ‘Cultural competence’ refers to ‘a set of behaviors, attitudes and policies that enable a system, agency and/or individual to function effectively with culturally diverse clients and communities’. This course is for those who work in marital counseling or the mental health sector and want to make a difference.
