This course will take you through the ins-and-outs of looking after children from birth onwards. Early development starts the moment a child is born. Since a baby cannot express themselves or fully understand us, care must be demonstrated by actions, words, and merely taking the time. The first type of interaction a baby has with a parent or caretaker is through physical interaction. You will learn how to make an infant feel that they are genuinely cared for and how to help them develop a sense of security. Childcare can also contribute to strong emotional, physical and mental health. You will be taught the responsibilities of a caretaker and why they must be aware of certain activities that enable or hinder a child's development across many areas. You will also look at the value of a routine in a young person's life and how routine brings another kind of comfort to children. In this course, you will learn what aspects you should include when planning a care routine and also how flexible it should be.</p><p>As a newborn develops, so does their ability to communicate, and they begin taking on care tasks for themselves. You will learn about the different ways children express themselves which can include allowing them to feed themselves at family mealtimes. Children need sufficient food to provide strength and energy for normal development. Do you know what types of food should be included in a growing child's diet? It is vital for a parent or caretaker to be conscious of a well-balanced diet that contributes to strong bones, teeth and immune system. While still young, adults should teach children daily on personal hygiene standards. This course will show you different teaching techniques for teaching young children and making these actions stick. A simple and effective way of teaching them is through our own actions. When children see an adult washing their hands before meals or touching dirty surfaces, it will almost always result in the child imitating them. We will also consider the correct procedures to prevent an illness, accident or hazard. Measures presented in this course can be taken before these harmful circumstances arise as a precaution and how to proceed when a difficult situation presents itself in a young one's life.</p><p>The welfare of a child should always be a primary responsibility and some common ways people use to try to calm a small infant do more harm than good. Are you aware of the damage that can be caused by using incorrect calming methods on an infant? A caretaker must be conscious of the physical injuries caused by using negative calming techniques. If a provider suspects abuse or negligence, they must follow the adequate procedures found in this course so that help can be given swiftly and timely. A child's development depends on positive relationships and a partnership between parents, families and practitioners working together is fundamental. Anyone with an interest in the childcare industry will gain a lot from this free online early childhood development course and it will benefit caretakers, first-time mothers, teachers in their first job and anyone thinking about entering into a child-minding profession. It provides specific techniques and reasons behind keeping children safe, encouraging positive self-development, establishing a good education for special needs students and maintaining an upbuilding learning environment.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/3040\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
