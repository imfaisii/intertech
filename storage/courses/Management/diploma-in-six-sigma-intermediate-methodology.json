Before executing such a project, it is important to understand the difference between the DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) and the DMADV (define, measure, analyse, design, verify)&nbsp; methodologies. This course explores the steps of the Six Sigma DMAIC roadmap and the role of a Yellow Belt in a business process. It introduces you to how different voices can be translated to business requirements, as well as the required techniques for doing so. Have you considered what needs and requirements mean to a customer and an organization? This course teaches you about the processes involved in completing a project charter. You learn about the process of project team selection and the responsibilities of individual team members. Also, the material helps you have a better understanding of the concept of the measurement phase in Six sigma methodology.</p><p>You will also explore the techniques for creating project milestones and steps involved in creating a SIPOC (suppliers, inputs, process, outputs, customers) map. This course explains the steps involved in identifying baseline performances. Then, compare Minitab with other statistical software and discuss how waste in business processes can be identified. The course takes you through practical examples of the process of using an impact matrix to ascertain critical root causes of business problems. Study how data collection strategies can be created, as well as the use of sampling. The material explains how to apply additional analysis, graphical techniques and basic charts to validate vital root causes.</p><p>Furthermore, you will learn how to create an impact effort matrix and various other basic charts. You will be able to explain the concept of a Pareto chart and how it can be used to rank measures in decreasing order of occurrence. You will also learn the procedure for measuring the extent of a business problem, as well as how the solution can be selected. Explore the meaning of risk analysis and how a pilot solution can be carried out. The course will help you improve your understanding of what a control plan is used for and how it can be created.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4170\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
