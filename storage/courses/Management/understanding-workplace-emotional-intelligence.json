We begin by exploring the history progression of this idea and comparing it to the traditional perception of intelligence quotient (IQ). We compare the different models used to understand EL before exploring their practical significance in the workplace.</p><p>The course traces the relationship between EI and job performance. We identify which EI metrics are more accurate predictors of job performance. We then describe the impact of EL on employees’ work-life balance. The course defines concepts like ‘emotional labour’, ‘deep acting’ and ‘surface acting’. We also lay out the causes and symptoms of emotional exhaustion and outline their impact on job performance.</p><p>We unpack the role of EL in the context of leadership to provide the training you require to bring out the best in those around you. We compare task-oriented and socio-emotional behaviours and lay out the characteristics of authentic leaders capable of employing empathy, priming and an enriched emotional vocabulary to manage conflict and encourage excellence. This course demonstrates the use of proper emotional expression and regulation to help you improve your EL and harness it as valuable professional skill.
