Both utilize complex maritime transport technologies supported by standardized rules, regulations, procedures and techniques. These are due to its members’ and stakeholders’ observations from past behaviors and accidents. Such standards have now taken effect in transporting large quantities of timber and container cargo onboard ships travelling from one end of the world to another. This course explores the different regulations, procedures and techniques relevant to the safe stowage handling of timber along with container cargoes. We outline precautionary measures taken from pre-loading through loading to shipping across the seas and finally to unloading at the destination point. Finally, we consider the current trends set by shippers and regulators in choosing ships, containers and materials for the effective transportation of cargoes.</p><p>This course then discusses the processes, techniques, and rules of stowing timber and container cargoes, including their components relevant to ship stowage. First, you will learn about handling stowed timber and container cargoes on board ships for sea transport. Then you will study various aspects of timber cargoes relevant to their complex characteristics of stowage and handling onboard ships. We analyze the fundamentals of timber cargo from proper stowing procedures, lashing and loading preparations of timber deck cargoes. We then examine container ship types, container stowage details and fleet trends as significant aspects of container cargo. We evaluate the implications of owning versus leasing containers. This course offers valuable teachings on perspectives of timber and container cargoes, including expert views on manufacturing containers, together with container ownership and leasing. Depending on their content, you will identify different cargo materials in ports or onboard vessels through the markings and descriptions.

We investigate the elements of different types of containers with their traceable markings alongside the appropriate forms of timber acceptable onboard vessels. These range from planks, deals, battens, ends, scantlings, log, wood chips, poles and pit props. We guide you through a discourse on the characteristics of materials stored in cargo containers and the expected effect of failing to stow or handle them appropriately before, during and after loading them on ships. You will also evaluate timber features, including how best they should be handled and stowed on vessels. The course will be of significant interest to students, logistic entrepreneurs, researchers, loggers, marine engineers and anyone seeking to learn about the proper stowage and handling of timber and container cargoes on board ships.
