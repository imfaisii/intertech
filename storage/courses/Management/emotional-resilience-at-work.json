If you are angry, how do you react? Are you controlled and rational or do you say the first thing that comes to mind? How do you react to pressure? How do you manage stressful situations? How do you manage your emotional responses to events? How do others influence the way you react to certain events? The emotional resilience of those involved in a business will contribute significantly to the organization's success. Almost all of us work in a business environment that is constantly changing and people who are able to handle themselves well as situations change have, what psychologists call, resilience – an ability to be flexible and cope with problems and setbacks.&nbsp;</p><p>Resilient people are able to manage and work with their emotions effectively. They are able to utilise their capabilities, strengths and robustness to manage and recover from problems and challenges, which may include job loss, financial problems, illness, medical emergencies, natural disasters, divorce or the death of a loved one. Emotional resilience means being able to adapt to adversity and major change without lasting difficulties and, generally, do this in a calm, rational manner. Those who lack resilience may instead become emotionally overwhelmed by these experiences and have a much harder time with stress and major and minor life changes. They may dwell on problems and use unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with such challenges. Generally, these individuals recover from setbacks more slowly and may experience more emotional and psychological distress as a result. Some of what this course will teach you includes the characteristics and behaviours of resilient people and teams, ways in which to cope with unpredictability, and how to develop resilience.</p><p>This course is designed to help you to understand more about the role of emotions in stress management and will give you specific techniques on how to develop your emotional resilience and use these skills at work. The course is crammed with insights and practical tips on the best ways to manage stress you should enrol if you want to develop your own personal resilience and understand how to develop resilience within the hearts and minds of your team and your organization.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
