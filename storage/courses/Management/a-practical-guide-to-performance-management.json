In such situations, pressure-induced panic can lead to poor quality work. Pressure is an inevitable part of our daily lives but thinking and acting sensibly while stressed is not easy. If you can maintain your cool in a challenging, high-pressure situation and manage your performance, you will be in a better position to lead your team to success. Conversely, failure to cope with increased anxiety may hurt your performance. If you are a manager or a team leader, you not only need to optimise your own mindset and performance but must also make sure your stressed colleagues can produce their best work. In this management training course, we help you to develop the skills required to manage the stress that comes with working under pressure, counteract its negative effects and use strategies that can help your team excel.</p><p>Pressure does not only create negative effects but too much of it can be harmful. We explore the psychology of pressure and trace its effects on performance. We identify situations that trigger the pressure that leads to stress and explain how to manage both. Communication breakdowns among employees are common when pressure rises, leading to poor performance and workplace conflict. Pressure can also elicit psychological reactions like anxiety, panic attacks and anger. We walk you through the coping mechanisms that can help you relieve the pressure felt by your team. We also explain how to plan ahead, anticipate risks and smooth your path to your goals, all of which will make work less stressful and harrowing.</p><p>Leaders play an important role in shaping organisational culture and we describe the qualities and skills of a good leader. We compare ‘real leaders’ and ‘safe leaders’ and provide methods you can use to build a resilient team, manage its energy levels, cultivate a ‘success mentality’, produce quality work and meet deadlines. We trace the link between work-related stress and productivity and introduce you to its triggers before outlining proven stress management techniques. Finally, we go through the legal duties of employers to manage stress set out in both Statutory and Common laws of the UK. Ability to handle pressure often defines the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful person. This management training course provides the leadership principles and skills you need to flourish under pressure and manage a successful team. Sign up to learn the psychology of stress and bring out the best in your team as you lead it to success.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
