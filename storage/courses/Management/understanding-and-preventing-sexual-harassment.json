We begin by exploring the classifications of sexual harassment and its various forms. We study the difference between 'quid pro quo' arrangements and harassment that results in a 'hostile environment' at work. We then go through the various myths surrounding this subject, from the clothes you wear to the role of alcohol, and compare facts to fiction.</p><p>When it comes to sexual harassment, it is important that you know your rights and those of the people around you. This human resources training course lays out the guidelines for handling sexual abuse but is designed to benefit anyone who works around people. We explain what to do if you witness harassment and establish the importance of being an ‘active bystander’. We trace the legal routes to follow in such situations and examine various workplace policies put in place to protect the safety and dignity of all employees. We discuss how to avoid being implicated in any form of harassment or sexual assault and provide steps you can take to stop it from happening to you.</p><p>In the course’s final section, we study sexual harassment in more detail and focus on preventing it in the workplace. This section delves deeper into the many types of sexual harassment and explains how to gather evidence, respond to allegations and protect your employees if you are in a managerial position. We explain what goes into a work policy governing this kind of behaviour before demonstrating how to introduce such a policy to your staff as you put preventative measures in place. This important course is ideal for anyone who wants to learn more about workplace sexual harassment to play a constructive role in preventing it from happening to themselves or their colleagues. Such knowledge can also keep you out of legal and professional trouble so sign up for this training course to learn where the boundaries are and how to stay on the right side of them.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5235\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
