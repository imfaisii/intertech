Tourism can be described as a short-term journey to places of interest outside of the typical environment for leisure or business. This course will differentiate between business and leisure tourism and travel. First, we will consider the motivating factors for tourism, the three primary categories of tourist destinations and the components of tourism products and services. Then we will identify the many encompassing functions and responsibilities of a travel and tour operator.</p><p>We will then investigate the consumer trends affecting the future of tour operations and the primary duties of the tour operations department in marketing and promotions. Here’s your chance to unravel the two main types of travel agencies and the strategic responsibilities of a travel agent. Listening is crucial to have excellent communication. We will therefore identify the traits of an active listener. You will learn how to enhance your communication skills by removing the barriers to active listening, making your travel experience better or your job in the travel industry more productive.</p><p>The failure to provide quality products and customer care will inhibit the ability of a travel and tourism business to attract and retain customers. In this vein, you will study effective strategies for quality customer management. We will examine the impact of COVID-19 on tourism and propose actions for recovery from the pandemic. We will also explore the effects of Brexit and the challenges to productivity in the tourism industry and crisis and transport management procedures. By taking this course, you will master modern technologies and sustainable strategies for travel and tourism.
