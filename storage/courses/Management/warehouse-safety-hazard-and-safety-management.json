Warehouses are important for storing goods and allow business owners to continue producing throughout the year, selling their goods whenever there is sufficient demand. However, these goods are exposed to many risks. The possibility of theft, deterioration or casualties during the moving process all contribute to these risks. They can be eliminated or reduced significantly with trained staff, sound equipment and sensible safety measures. This course explores the safety measures and approaches to employ in a warehouse to minimise these risks. Following that, you will learn about the importance of warehouse safety training.</p><p>When carrying out a task in a warehouse, accidents and hazards are likely to feature and consequently cause minor or major injuries. We'll look at the potential dangers and how risk is assessed in a warehouse setting and lay out the legal obligations that must be followed to ensure safety. There are various types of warehouses and each type operates differently. Discover the classes, their method of operation and their functions. For a warehouse to function correctly, the health and safety of its staff need to be managed effectively. We'll teach you the concept of workforce management, health and safety management and employees' obligations in ensuring their safety.</p><p>In performing any manual handling tasks, including holding, pushing or pulling, a worker can sustain internal or external injuries. You’ll investigate manual and mechanical handling, the causes of injuries and musculoskeletal disorders. Warehouses with an effective system of organising and storing goods make better use of their space and are more efficient. We will analyse the storage systems of warehouses and their classification. Learn about the safe use of pallets, automated retrieval systems, temperature-controlled storage and more. There is no prior knowledge required to take this course. It is designed for those who want to ensure the safety of both goods and staff in a warehouse.
