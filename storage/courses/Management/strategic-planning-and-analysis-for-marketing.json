This course will teach you how to identify goals and objectives, determine the critical changes in the identified objectives and decide on the best resources to use to achieve them. When done correctly, market analysis provides information about industries, customers, competitors and other market variables, which helps improve your business ideas and propel your company to the next level. Unfortunately, most companies lack good market analysts, who have proven to be a requirement for driving any institution to greater heights. This course will teach you how to make strategic decisions that will ensure a dynamic and changing environment and formulate alternative methods of action with long-term, desirable consequences. Discover the three prerequisites for strategic thinking. These include having a clear goal in mind, understanding the environment and being creative in developing effective responses to those forces.</p><p>In this course, you will learn about competitive analysis, which is a process by which firms define and attempt to understand their industry. When companies pay close attention to their competitors, they constantly compare their products, prices, channels and promotional efforts. We will teach you about the mission statement’s components, how to conduct a ‘strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats’ (SWOT) analysis and positioning analysis to determine how similarly competing products are perceived by customers in terms of essential features. Learn about benchmarking, which compares operations and performance to recognised standards and improves those operations to increase effectiveness. Finally, you will learn to use competitive intelligence to gather, analyse and distribute data about current and potential competitors.</p><p>We present embedded knowledge and describe practical steps you can take to propel your organisation to greater heights. This includes measures for strategic and marketing planning. We provide you with the skills necessary to analyse your organisation's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, which lets you determine how suitable a particular market is for your industry. We then outline the procedures needed to create a strategic plan and assist organisational leaders in determining their future vision, goals and objectives. We have designed this course for anyone who wants to become a strategic planner.
