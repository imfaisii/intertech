This human resources and management training course defines ‘sexual harassment’ and explains how to recognise its various forms. We then describe its effects, warning indications and common misconceptions. We outline the Sex Discrimination Act and other UK laws related to workplace harassment. Workplaces are negatively impacted by sexual harassment, which is a kind of sex discrimination, and it is critical to handle such cases in a way that protects both the dignity of the rights of your colleagues and organisation productivity.</p><p>The course outlines both employers' and employees' responsibilities to prevent sexual harassment at work and provides some useful strategies, like victims seeking external help to deal with harassment. Workplaces typically employ human resource management (HRM) practices and employ sexual harassment policies and procedures to prevent wongdoing. We show you how managers and human resources offices can develop and implement in order to protect those around them from unwanted social interactions in the office.</p><p>Workplace sexual harassment is a severe issue. While it is sometimes regarded as a joke, it may make people's life miserable and substantially impair their ability to do their jobs. Managers must therefore prevent sexual harassment and where such measures fail, respond effectively to complaints. This HRM training course explains how to address sexual harassment, including how to handle complaints, carry out investigations and more. This course is ideal for anyone who wants to build a positive workplace culture that respects boundaries but is particularly useful to human resources officers and managers. Sign up to learn how to prevent workplace sexual harassment and add a useful skill to your professional portfolio.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5422\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
