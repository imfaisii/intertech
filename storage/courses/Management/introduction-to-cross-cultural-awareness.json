We then explore the perceptions and various cultural values that affect the relationships among people from different backgrounds. We explain how to interpret and respond to cultural differences in ways that build healthy relationships through appropriate responses that accommodate diverse viewpoints. The course shows you how improved listening skills can help you to overcome cultural barriers to communication.</p><p>We then explore the concept of ‘cross-cultural design’, which refers to the strategies used to design technology for people from many cultures. We examine the communication platforms required for cross-cultural communication and introduce you to leadership management principles that enhance cohesion and productivity in multicultural teams.
