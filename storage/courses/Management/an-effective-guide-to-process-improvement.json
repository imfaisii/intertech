This course shows you its importance and why organisations adopt process improvement strategies. A process map aids in illustrating the flow of work visually. You'll explore the role of process mapping in a project and how it helps locate areas of concern for troubleshooting and fixing problems. You'll also learn about the types of processes concerning the current, desired and future state of a procedure. The term 'bottleneck' refers to some form of constraint hindering a project's performance. You will study different terminology related to its analysis to understand and indicate the flow of a process at various stages in your workplace.</p><p>There are several steps associated with delivering process improvement. We demonstrate every step in a process improvement project, such as process identification, mapping and so on. We will teach you how to use different mapping tools, the purpose of using the tools and the desired outcomes you can obtain with the help of the process mapping tools. A case study provides a detailed analysis of a scenario in a real-world context. The instructor, Robert Chapman, presents a case study from his work experience and reveals how you can reduce cycle time, waste and the number of departments in an organisation that may not be necessary to carry out a process. Next, you'll explore how to improve the customer experience of the product/service alongside saving organisational resources.</p><p>We designed this course for people that want to make a process more efficient and effective in an organisation.
