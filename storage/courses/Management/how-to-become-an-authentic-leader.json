We see great leaders like Mother Teresa, Steve Jobs, Nelson Mandela, and Elon Musk stand out for advancing society across many sectors, including government, business, entertainment, sports and so on. If you dream of joining their ranks, this free online course is for you. We begin by defining ‘leadership’ and describing what sets a true leader apart from those around them in order to become more than simply a ‘boss’ or ‘manager’.</p><p>Certain qualities and character traits, including sincerity and vision coupled with compassion and a genuine desire to do good, are foundational to leadership success. We explain how leadership is an earned privilege and not a right and that there are important leadership qualities you need to possess that inspire others to follow you. A leader’s primary role is to set the team’s overall direction and help guide its members smoothly and efficiently while tracking their progress. Leaders must thus comprehend teamwork because they need to reach goals through the efforts of other people. The course explores humility and passion and shows you how to exercise good judgement, self-discipline, loyalty and commitment while you lead by example.</p><p>We cover a host of practical leadership skills, from good communication to problem-solving. Persuasion is critical, so we provide the ability to use speech, the written word and other communication channels to make your point effectively. However, an authentic leader must also decisively solve problems, and we show you how to do so by employing skills like active listening, analysis, research and creativity. Becoming a good leader is not reserved for a few with natural talent: it is a skill that you can learn through hard work and dedication.
