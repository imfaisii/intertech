Is your business process taking a long time to complete, requiring more resources than planned,or producing inconsistent results? Then you're likely experiencing a process breakdown and your business operation needs improvement and change in strategies. The most challenging question is: what do you need to improve in the business process? Process improvement helps to pinpoint inefficiencies within a business. The ultimate goal is to minimise errors, reduce waste, improve productivity, optimise performance and meet best practice standards. This course will help you understand the fundamentals of process improvement. We will also apprise you of the primary tools used for process improvement and how to use these tools to identify and enhance the most critical aspects of your business process.&nbsp;</p><p>The first step toward process improvement is identifying what's slowing the operation or increasing waste in your business. We will teach you how to identify the triggers that point toward processes in need of improvement. You will learn how to map a process in its current state, identify the value-add and non-value-add steps and use data to understand the improvement opportunities. You will explore the usefulness of mapping 'As-is', 'To-be' and 'Realised' process maps and how they help analyse process data and describe the relationship between the process and the outcomes. After making changes based on process improvement operations, you will need to check whether your interventions have made a positive difference. We will show you the correct procedure for testing the improved process and updating it. Your instructor, Robert Chapman, will also show you a live demonstration of using the eight steps he used for an organisation.</p><p>Various tools, including Swim lanes, Value stream maps, Time value maps, Value-add charts and Spaghetti diagrams, are used for viewing and analysing process data. You'll explore these tools used in mapping business processes and learn how to use them from the examples in this course. The tools and techniques taught in this course apply to any management system process. For example, suppose you are a small business owner, project manager or business improvement professional. In that case, this course will help you develop your knowledge and skill to amend and improve various processes for your organisation confidently. This course is for anyone who wants to learn how to improve their organisation’s processes, correctly quantify process performance and implement improvements. So why wait?
