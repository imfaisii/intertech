Organisations with a dysfunctional culture struggle to satisfy customers and retain employees. In this course, we'll define ‘organisational cultural change’ and provide a list of tools and techniques for changing and improving an organisation's culture.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Do you know that your organisation's culture can impact its performance and revenue growth? Your organisation's culture greatly influences the success and general wellbeing of your business, employees and customers. All employee behaviour is controlled and guided by the values, expectations and practices that make up the organisation's culture. The right cultures are the ones that thrive, while organisations with the wrong culture struggle to grow. It is therefore imperative to understand why your company is the way it is and whether or not it should change. This course highlights the importance of organisation culture and covers in great detail how to identify those with dysfunctional structures and fix them. We begin by introducing you to organisational culture and its importance. We then explain what a ‘culture change’ is and discuss its purpose and importance to an institution.</p><p>How can a company's culture be changed? Are there tools that can assist in changing the culture of an organisation? Your instructor, Robert Chapman, will explain how to identify organisations with a toxic culture and how to transform them. We'll also introduce you to the various tools you can use to change the culture of any company. We'll explore how to do this through formal training programmes and alter it through mentoring, development, process reform, management culture, communication and collaboration.</p><p>Although it is beneficial to transform a dysfunctional organisation's culture, change does not occur immediately. Some culture change tools can change a company's culture more quickly than others. Discover which tools are most effective in the short, medium and long term. There are several steps to take and questions to ask before you begin the process of initiating a culture change. You will learn about these steps and what to strive for. Finally, Robert will show you a case study of how he has implemented culture change within an organisation. This course is essential for entrepreneurs, business owners, industry managers and anyone interested in changing the culture of any organisation. No prior knowledge is needed and you can increase employee satisfaction and engagement, help your business retain talent and accrue many other benefits. So why wait?
