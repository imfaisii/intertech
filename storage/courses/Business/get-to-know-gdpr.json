This new framework came into law on 25 May 2018 and many people are still not sure what penalties can apply or what the standards are or how they differ for personal and organizational data.</p><p>We define ‘data protection’ and investigate its data protection. We then identify your rights and cover topics like consent, data subject access, data breaches and data transfers. We lay out the requirements to become a EU GDPR representative (or a United Kingdom representative after Brexit) and outline possible administrative fines and how to apply the relevant law.</p><p>This training course suits anyone who needs to learn about privacy and data protection regulations. These rules apply beyond the borders of the EU and affect most web content so this course benefits those working in data security and web design. Many people ignore messages about ‘cookies’ while surfing the web but you may need to understand how they work so sign up to add this valuable skill to your portfolio.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
