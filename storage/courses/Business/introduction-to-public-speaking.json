It might have been in your school, religious organization, workplace or elsewhere? And were you nervous about it? Research has shown that even some of the most established public speakers feel nervous when speaking to an audience. Apart from the anxiety public speakers experience, many are unfamiliar with the dos and don'ts to deliver an effective public speech. For example, it's crucial to have a firm grasp on the topic you will be talking about. And do you have an idea of what your audience looks like and what they are interested in? How do you know your message will add value to their lives? This course will help you answer these and many more questions with confidence, and by the time you're done with this course, you'll be ready to start speaking like a pro.</p><p>We will start by examining the importance of public speaking. Together, we will study the interactional model, the dialogic theory of public speaking, which will give you a better understanding of public speaking. The course further discusses the ethics of public speaking, examining the ethics pyramid and free speech rights. Is the right to free speech absolute? You will be able the answer this by the end of this course. Suppose you get nervous or anxious before speaking. In that case, we will equip you with more insights to understand the sources of communication apprehension and how to deal with it. The course goes on to examine the differences between listening and hearing. It's important to know if your audience is actually listening to you or merely hearing you speak and how to rectify this if it's the latter. Finally, we will discuss the concept of 'audience analysis'. If you're about to speak about a touchy or controversial subject, you need to know how to speak without offending your audience. This course will show you how to get a realistic idea of the background of your audience before delivering a speech. Our audience analysis guidelines will also equip you to engage with divergent views constructively.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a professional speaker looking to improve your public speaking skills, look no further than this course. It is also suitable for students looking to learn more about public speaking. It has all the ingredients you need to become the speaker you have been dreaming of becoming. We have compiled a course that will transform you from a poor speaker to a better, confident speaker. Do you know that public speaking is not limited to a group of people in an auditorium? With the rise of social media, people voice their opinions on various topics such as politics, entertainment, sports, and national issues. This is why the skills taught in this course will be helpful, regardless of your public speaking medium. So, what are you still waiting for? Join in on the ride and start speaking with confidence.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/3770\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.

While many Americans look upon being active as something to admire, to engage in, and to excel at, listening is often understood as a “passive” activity. In this topic, we will look at listening for what it is.</div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"BbDn4\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed selected-class   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\">You may have heard the adage, “We have two ears but only one mouth”—an easy way to remember that listening can be twice as important as talking. As a student, you most likely spend many hours in a classroom doing a large amount of focused listening, yet sometimes it is difficult to apply those efforts to communication in other areas of your life.

You know it’s not all the same, but it isn’t always clear how to separate the truth from the messages that are misleading or even blatantly false. Nor is it always clear which messages are intended to help the listener and which ones are merely self-serving for the speaker.

Problems occur when messages are repeated to others who have not yet developed the skills to discern the difference between a valid message and a mistaken one. Critical listening can be particularly difficult when the message is complex. Unfortunately, some speakers may make their messages intentionally complex to avoid critical scrutiny.
