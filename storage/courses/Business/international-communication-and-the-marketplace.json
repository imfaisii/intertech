It explores various cultures and explains political, legal and economic systems. We then provide best practices for individuals experiencing new cultural environments to help you avoid misunderstandings as we examine common styles of management. This course can improve your intercultural communication and help you take a management path.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>This course provides a thorough analysis of intercultural and international relations and their supporting systems. We open with an overview of intercultural communications that unpacks culture, its many defining perspectives and how these perspectives affect our ability to communicate effectively. We then demonstrate how to engage effectively in intercultural interaction, considering contexts and utilizing recommended approaches. We go through common cultural characteristics and how they can reflect on specific communities. The course then moves on to study divergent cultural characteristics, ‘explicit-rule’ and ‘implicit-rule’ cultures and their individual peculiarities. We lay out Berger and Calabrese’s ‘seven axioms of uncertainty’ and investigate other cultural elements like ‘time orientation’ and approaches to ‘masculine’ versus ‘feminine’ values.</p><p>While delving into the world of international cultures and relations, we introduce you to various political, legal, economical and ethical systems and their impact. This helps you understand why countries have certain political systems and makes clear their effect on international trade. We compare different management styles and theories (like McGregor’s ‘Theory X, Theory Y and Theory Z’) and identify their supporting ideals. The world is shrinking and cultural exchange is becoming more common so this course provides best practices for acculturation and communicating with the world.</p><p>The world is now considered a ‘global village’ because individuals have found easier ways to exchange knowledge, ideas, cultures and more, through physical travel and communication via media. Such interaction is driven by the exchange of meaning, which is made easier by effective cultural appreciation. Because business is now truly international, you need to be prepared for when your role as a business communicator crosses cultures, languages, values, legal systems and borders. This free online management course explains the cultural characteristics common to business spaces worldwide and reviews the effects of intercultural communication on management styles and the global marketplace. We offer a rich blend of resources and exercises to aid learning and can help you hone your international and intercultural communication skills.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.

Hall is often cited as a pioneer in the field of intercultural communication. Born in 1914, Hall spent much of his early adulthood in the multicultural setting of the American Southwest, where Native Americans, Spanish-speakers, and descendants of pioneers came together from diverse cultural perspectives.

Economies are often described on the relationship between people and their government. An economy with a high degree of government intervention may prove challenging for both internal and external businesses. An economy with relatively little government oversight may be said to reflect more of the market(s) and to be less restricted. Along these same lines, the government may perceive its role as a representative of the common good, to protect individual consumers, and to prevent fraud and exploitation.<div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"VT81I\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed selected-class   ui-resizable\" style=\"position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px; max-width: 417px;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" spellcheck=\"false\">This continuum or range, from high to low degrees of government involvement, reflects the concept of government itself. A government may be designed to give everyone access to the market, with little supervision, in the hope that people will regulate transactions based on their own needs, wants, and desires; in essence, their own self-interest. If everyone operates in one’s self-interest and word gets out that one business produces a product that fails to work as advertised, it is often believed that the market will naturally gravitate away from this faulty product to a competing product that works properly. Individual consumers, however, may have a hard time knowing which product to have faith in and may look to the government to provide that measure of safety. </div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"cLXxt\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list image, listed ui-resizable\" style=\"position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px; max-width: 280px; touch-action: auto;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"img-edit editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope None ng-not-empty hideText\" data-ng-click=\"addThumbnails(); changeFileType($index)\"><img draggable=\"draggable\" class=\"my-preview2\" src=\"images/1613344199963359951.jpg\"><div class=\"img-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>Select an Image from the Gallery</p><span class=\"icon-image\"></span></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"uzzsH\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed ui-resizable\" style=\"position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" spellcheck=\"false\"><h4>Economic and Ethical Systems</h4></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"VUZ50\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed ui-resizable   border\" style=\"position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px; max-width: 746px;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" spellcheck=\"false\"><b>Economic Systems<br></b>Economic systems vary in similar ways across cultures and again reflect the norms and customs of people.

Individual consumers, however, may have a hard time knowing which product to have faith in and may look to the government to provide that measure of safety. </div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"cLXxt\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list image, listed ui-resizable\" style=\"position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px; max-width: 280px; touch-action: auto;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"img-edit editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope None ng-not-empty hideText\" data-ng-click=\"addThumbnails(); changeFileType($index)\"><img draggable=\"draggable\" class=\"my-preview2\" src=\"images/1613344199963359951.jpg\"><div class=\"img-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>Select an Image from the Gallery</p><span class=\"icon-image\"></span></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"dLQcH\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h4>Styles of Management</h4></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"2OqJm\" data-space=\"space\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list , listed selected-class   space ui-resizable\" style=\"height: 54px; max-width: 141px;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"space editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-empty\"></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"DFUHJ\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list image, listed   ui-resizable\" style=\"max-width: 417px; touch-action: auto;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"img-edit editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope ng-not-empty None hideText\" data-ng-click=\"addThumbnails(); changeFileType($index)\"><img draggable=\"draggable\" class=\"my-preview2\" src=\"images/1613345972781986676.jpg\"><div class=\"img-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>Select an Image from the Gallery</p><span class=\"icon-image\"></span></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"42ogg\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed   ui-resizable border\" style=\"touch-action: auto;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" spellcheck=\"false\">People and their relationships to dominant and subordinate roles are a reflection of culture and cultural viewpoint.
