This course will discuss the difference between whole and term life insurance. You will learn that a term life insurance policy lasts for only a fixed number of years depending on the policy while a whole life insurance policy lasts for the duration of the policy holder's life. This course will also discuss premium and beneficiary.</p><p>The acronym IRA stands for Individual Retirement Account. This course will discuss the Traditional IRA and Roth IRA, which are two crucial types of IRAs. You will learn that if you withdraw money early from a Traditional IRA account, you will have to pay penalties and taxes. This course will also discuss the 401(K) which is very similar to a Traditional IRA. You will learn that in the Roth IRA tax is not deferred, while in a 401(K) tax is deferred.</p><p>Having adequate life insurance and retirement savings are two very important aspects of personal financial planning. This course will make sure you understand the basic forms of both life insurance and retirement savings with an emphasis on its application in the U.S. You will learn how it can help support dependents, and provide immediate cash at death that can help pay the deceased's debts, funeral expenses, and income or estate taxes.
