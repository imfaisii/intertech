It takes you through the methods used to find the zeros of a polynomial function. You will also be introduced to the method used to draw a polynomial equation graph and find a polynomial function equation. Study the concept of rate of change together with the methods used in finding the slope of the tangent to a curve then learn about derivations, differentiability, and continuity. This course teaches you the essential techniques covered by the intermediate value theorem. You will study the differentiation rules, derivations of trigonometric functions, and the procedure used for differentiating a parametrized curve. Higher-order derivatives will also be covered as well as the application and differentiation of implicit functions.</p><p>Taking this course will provide you with the knowledge of the derivations of functions and the procedures for finding derivatives using logarithmic differentiation. You will be taught about the applications of the derivative in real-life problems. Learn about the linear approximations, the concept of Newton's method, and the application of the L'Hopital rule. Study the expansion of a binomial in addition to the application and the proof of the power rule. You will also study the applications and methods used to prove the rule for keeping a multiplicative constant. Do you know how to carry out the conversion process from rectangular to polar coordinates? The course shows you how to represent an odd number, dummy variable and how to use sigma notation to write an average formula. It also explains how to list the first four terms of sequence and the monotonic behaviour of a sequence. If you have struggled with understanding the properties and laws of the definite integral, then this course is for you.</p><p>Furthermore, you will also learn how to use the mathematical induction technique and the representation of the sigma sum. This course takes you through the use of Riemann sums with subintervals to estimate the distance travelled by a particle whose velocity is given. You will also learn how to reconfigure the integral in terms, as well as the natural exponential functions. Do you know how to list the first four terms of sequence and the monotonic behaviour of a sequence? This course will help you get a better understanding of the counting trick of counting ordered partitions of n. It explains in detail the steps required in finding the area under a curve, as well as the calculus techniques that can be employed to solve ancient problems of calculating complex areas.

The distance from your home is changing with time. If you left home at 7 am, drove 90 miles to work, and arrived at 8:30, your average speed was 60 mph. Did you burst out of your garage at 60 mph? Were you doing 60 when you entered the parking lot at work? I hope not!!! <div><br></div>60 mph was your average speed. Your speed varied over the course of your trip. Now if you hit a pothole, an auto mechanic might ask you how fast you were going at the moment you hit the pothole. He isn’t interested in your average speed, but at your speed at a particular instant! How do we calculate this?<div><br></div>As you will see, when one variable quantity, y, depends on another, x, the derivative will tell us the instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to x. The quantities might be distance and time (as in the above pothole example above), momentum and velocity, financial assets and time, air pressure, and height, to name just a few examples.
