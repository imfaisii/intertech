This enables a brand to improve both the quality and benefits of its products.</p><p>We then see how a brand can stir up emotional reactions in the hearts of potential clients through effective storytelling and messaging. This helps you to integrate your brand into every aspect of your business by being consistent in your brand building.

According to Harvard Business School, 95% of purchasing decisions are based on feelings rather than logic.

In other words, having a great product or service isn’t enough, you need a great brand personality to match.</div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"qjQmw\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed selected-class   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\"><div>Your brand’s personality is what allows your business to make a personal connection with your audience. Just as people have values, goals, beliefs (and even flaws), so do organizations. If your brand was a person, how would describe him or her? Customers aren’t looking for another cookie-cutter company that offers the same thing as everyone else.
