It is important to understand how to represent an odd number, dummy variable and how to use sigma notation to write an average formula. Before working with the formulas for the sums of sequences, you must know the sigma laws. This course takes you through how to use the mathematical induction technique, as well as the representation of the sigma sum. It also introduces you to the various types of finite sequences, sequences defined by a recursive formula, arithmetic sequence and geometric sequence. Have you considered analyzing how triangular numbers can be written as the sum of consecutive positive integers? This course will teach you the essential techniques to do so.</p><p>If you want to explore how a sequence can be bounded to converge, how to list the first four terms of a sequence and its monotonic behaviour, then sign up. By the end, you will be able to explain enumerative, closed-form, recursive definition, as well as the concept of convergence of series. Next, the material will help you understand the Fibonacci sequence, the ratio of successive terms, as well as the concept of the golden ratio. Do you know the trick of counting ordered partitions of n using 1's and 2's? The course also analyzes the theorem that can yield the sum of the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence. It further explains how to convert presented series into closed-form and vice-versa. The material should clarify any challenges you face in understanding geometric series and how divergence theorem can be used to indicate the necessary condition.</p><p>You will also learn about the process involved in subtracting the second series from the first, as well as how to take the limit of both sides of the last equation. Study the concept of the integral test, the determination of series when it converges or diverges, as well as the p-test for intervals and series. Do you know there is a specific analysis for the ratio test? This course will help you get a better understanding of the alternating series test and alternating harmonic series. It will explain in detail the Maclaurin series and how the Taylor series can be a generalized form of the Maclaurin series centred at an arbitrary value. This free online course will be of great interest to business students and anyone who uses business maths, especially the fundamentals of sequences and convergence series.
