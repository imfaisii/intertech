You will see how the printing press revolutionized mass media, enabling the dissemination of political, economic and current affairs information to people of all classes. You will learn how publishers such as Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst successfully 'dumbed down' news, using sensationalism and tabloid formats.</p><p>You will learn about the decline in print journalism and readership, as a result of alternative media, such as radio, television and the Internet. Many independent news organisations have closed down or have been subsumed by large corporate interests. Consequently many journalists and content creators have made the transition to online publishing. You will explore different styles of journalism: objective, interpretive, literary, precision, advocacy, consensus and conflict.</p><p>In addition, you will learn about the history and development of magazines, as a vehicle for journalism and mass communication; how different types of magazines have brought news, entertainment, literature and photography to different audiences. Also in this course, you will learn about factors that influence what content is published and how, i.e. issues regarding editors, advertising and regulation.</p><p>In this free online course learn about the history of newspapers and magazines, and the role of journalists and other staff and their influence on business and politics. These lessons will be of great benefit to media professionals, and to any student who would like to learn more about the skills required for working as a professional journalist. So, check out the course today, and bring your journalistic skills to the next level.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/1648\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
