Unfortunately, most companies fail because of poor money management. In this course, we will explore some common mistakes to avoid to make sure your business stays on top of its finances. We will also contrast profit, revenue, business expenses and cash flow. Finally, you will view how monitoring these factors can lead to the overall health of your business.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Owning a small business can be rewarding but it can also be risky. Many businesses fail because they simply run out of money. While selling and making a profit, it is easy to think your business is doing well. However, without proper business budgeting and tracking expenses diligently, you may not easily discover that your business is suffering losses. This situation will make it difficult for you to stay on top of the overall health of your business and steer it toward greater success in the coming years. From the moment you begin this course, we address this issue.</p><p>Organizing your expenses into categories based on taxes and deductibles will help you have better control over your money. In addition, this will also aid you when filing your taxes. This course will provide information about managing your business's cash flow while recommending accounting software that makes the process seamless. You will also learn how to use other applications that help you generate a profit/loss statement and other essential documents to keep your business records up to date. Nevertheless, you will first see how to do this independently without these applications.</p><p>In the final section, you will learn about a common mistake that many small/medium business owners make: operating the same bank account for their expenses and business. On many occasions, this has caused severe problems for their companies. Besides being unable to ascertain how much money the firm is making or losing, they are forced to make higher tax payments based on the cash flow in the account. You will review practical suggestions on what to do to address this issue. Small and medium-sized business owners, as well as aspiring entrepreneurs, will benefit the most from taking this course.
