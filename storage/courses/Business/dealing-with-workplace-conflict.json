This course identifies and analyses the behaviours and attitudes that can lead to conflict. First, we explain why people behave the way they do in the workplace and establish the importance of communication in boosting productivity. We discuss the problems caused by miscommunication and outline the role of our personal experiences and learned behaviour in driving our actions.</p><p>This conflict management course shows you how to remain calm during a heated argument. We analyse anger and provide anger management skills to demonstrate how to deal with angry people, especially in the workplace. Even though both parties play a role in a conflict, taking personal responsibility is vital if you hope to reach a quick and constructive resolution. This course compares the different types of conflict: displaced, interpersonal, intrapersonal, intergroup, retaliatory and those arising from a conflict of interest. We study the consequences of conflict in the workplace and go through its physiological and behavioural aspects before outline various methods of conflict resolution.</p><p>Finally, this course explores the essential but often misunderstood concept of ‘comfort zones’. We explain how the mind tries to protect us from new situations and perceived threats by making us feel uncomfortable. Next, we examine strategies designed to reduce stress through better time management. Stress naturally leads to conflict and time can be a major source of workplace stress. This course has no prerequisites and demonstrates how to take action and set goals for your professional development. Managers, human resource officers, employees and anyone who wants to learn how to resolve conflict in the workplace can benefit from this course. Sign up to learn how to manage conflict, stress and time and add a valuable skill to your CV that can help you to defuse hostility in the workplace and take a management track.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5648\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
