You will learn that retention plans can help address employee turnover. Turnover is voluntary and involuntary loss of an employee and can be very expensive. The course will then teach you how to use exit interviews and/or surveys such as the Job Descriptive Index (JDI) survey. You will also discuss Maslow’s theory on motivation, Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation, McGregor’s theory on motivation, and the carrot-and-stick approach.</p><p>Next, the course will discuss the training and development of employees. Employee training and development is a core framework for helping employees. You will study the main types of training, the different training delivery methods, and how to design a training program. You will then look into the four types of communication styles including nonverbal communication as well as study the importance of listening. This will help you develop more effective management styles.</p><p>Retaining employees is an important component of any healthy organization, as high turnover rates can be very costly. Proper training and development will not only help employee retention but can help meet the higher level needs of the individual. This free online course on Modern Human Resource Management will guide you through the core theories that attempt to explain people’s motivation or lack of motivation at work, and show you how to train your employees in a truly professional manner.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/1489\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.

You groan to yourself, not looking forward to sitting in a conference room and seeing PowerPoint slide after PowerPoint slide. As you walk to the conference room, you run into a colleague who is taking the same training that day and commiserate on how boring this training is probably going to be. When you step into the conference room, however, you see something very different.<div><br></div><div>Computers are set up at every chair with a video ready to start on the computer. The HR manager greets you and asks you to take a seat. When the training starts, you are introduced (via video) on each of the computers to a series of sexual harassment example scenarios. The videos stop, and there is a recorded discussion about what the videos portrayed. Your colleagues in the Washington, DC, office are able to see the same training and, via video conferencing, are able to participate in the discussions.

Her facial expressions show she is upset, and after she enters, she crosses her arms while standing in front of Casey’s desk. Casey thinks Lily is a very hard worker and does an excellent job managing people as the manager of her marketing department. Lately, she has been having trouble with some of her employees.<div><br></div><div>“Casey,” she says, “I really need to vent. Can I sit down and talk with you?” Casey offers Lily a seat and she sits down. She tells Casey that Sam, a marketing manager, made snide and underhanded comments during a meeting this morning. “For example, when I asked the status on one of our projects, Sam said snidely, ‘Why don’t you ask one of your marketing assistants? They are doing such a great job, after all.’ I suspect he is upset with something I wrote on my blog last week. As you know, I started the blog to continually let employees know of changes in the department and to provide feedback. In last week’s blog, I wrote about what a great job the marketing assistants are doing in my department.” <div><br></div><div>Lily goes on, “So I pulled him aside after the meeting and asked him about his comment. He said that he was upset that I had given feedback to the marketing assistants because he feels that as their manager, it is his job to do that. He felt I had stepped on his toes and the toes of other marketing managers.”</div><div><br></div><div>Casey thinks about the situation and asks Lily if she apologized. Lily responds, “I didn’t feel like I needed to. I do think the marketing assistants are doing a good job, and I don’t need to apologize for mentioning that. I am just trying to raise morale among them. You know, two marketing assistants have quit in the last three months.”\nCasey leans back in his chair and gives some thought as to how to advise Lily. He suggests that Lily speak with Sam directly (not via e-mail) and tell him that her intention was only positive and not meant to be harmful, and see what happens. Lily thinks about that and says she will try to see Sam later today. When she leaves, Casey sits back and thinks about how communication is one of the biggest challenges in any job, but especially in human resources.&nbsp;<br></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\">\n<li id=\"agNOV\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None background ng-touched\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h5><b>Context - The Biggest Challenge</b></h5></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div>\n</li><li id=\"aW09Z\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed selected-class   ui-resizable border\">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\">Casey is seated at his desk reviewing his human resource strategic plan when Lily walks in, obviously upset.

They are doing such a great job, after all.’ I suspect he is upset with something I wrote on my blog last week.
