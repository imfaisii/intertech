Commercial banks handle day-to-day financial transactions, minor credit requests for mostly non-public borrowers and deposit insurance. Investment banks primarily help companies, institutions and large publicly traded corporations to manage their money. They handle large amounts of money and advise their clients about sound investments like underwriting, equity and debt securities, issuing stocks, mergers and acquisitions. They essentially act as intermediaries between investors (who have money to invest) and corporations (who require capital to grow and run their businesses). Investment banking is one of the most lucrative professions globally and a challenging profession. Do you wish to be a part of such a financial institution? This course will help you understand the basics of investments, the concept of the financial market and different investment strategies used to reach financial goals. We'll also walk you through the investment banking career path, including its educational and experience requirements.</p><p>Investment banks are mainly structured into three sections. Each section is distinct yet plays a vital role in ensuring the bank makes money, manages risk and works efficiently. We will show you the structure and different sides of an investment bank and the various functions of an investment banker. An investment bank provides a wide range of services and makes a profit by charging fees for these services. Explore the different services that investment banks offer, such as underwriting, sales and trading, equity research, asset management, etc. A critical function of an investment banker is to build financial models and use valuation methods to advise clients and complete deals. We will teach you the three most commonly used valuations methods, the mechanics involved in initial public offerings (IPOs) and the concept of mergers and acquisitions. We will help you understand what impacts rational and irrational behaviours have on investment banking, the relevant ethical issues and what ‘market abuse’ entails.</p><p>Whether you’re a recently graduated student with excellent numerical and analytical skills or a novice considering a career in investment banking, this course will help you gain knowledge on an investment bank's basic functioning and guide you along its path. If you're thinking of becoming an investment banker, all you need is an interest in finance and accounting and a willingness to learn and practise your skills. Knowledge of the different roles detailed in this course will help you choose the one that best suits your interests. The U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) reports that jobs in the securities, commodities and financial services category will grow by 10% by 2024. So if you are interested in a career as an investment banker, take this course and start your journey towards becoming a corporate financial adviser.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4573\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
