These measures show how far the organization has come, how far it still has to go, and whether it is going in the right direction. But performance measurement is not easy to accomplish and choosing inappropriate measures can result in unintended consequences, with detrimental outcomes. At the same time, the outputs of many processes are intangible and difficult to measure.
