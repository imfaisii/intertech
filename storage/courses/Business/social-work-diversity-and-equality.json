You will learn social work methods, the main functions of social work, the scope of this profession and how to become a social worker. We centre social work on meeting individual needs and growing human potential. Explore the ethics and values of social work, its principles, relationships and role. Diversity is the inclusion of a wide variety of people of different races or cultures in a group or organisation. For example, some individuals may discriminate against their coworkers based on their language, culture, skin colour or other perceived differences in a diverse work environment. We will show you the importance of a mixed workplace, the benefits of encouraging diversity and how to institute diversity recruitment in an organisation.</p><p>A stereotype is a generalised and oversimplified view about a group of people often learned from school, movies or television. You will learn how to identify the root cause of stereotypes and pick up methods to eliminate them for a friendly and productive workplace. Take firm steps within your organisation to educate managers and employees about discrimination and how workers must behave to avoid these practices. Discover the actions to prevent prejudice from happening and develop anti-discriminatory policies and ways to discourage it in the workplace. You will also learn how to tell if you have been discriminated against and recognise potential signs for yourself and others. A discrimination complaint is an allegation by an employee of unfair treatment in some aspect of their work based upon the individual's unique attributes. Understand the steps to follow if they are involved in a&nbsp; complaint regardless of whether they are an employee or manager.</p><p>We have designed this course for social work and human resource management students.

With technology and ease of travel, organisations and businesses hire more talented people from multiple regions, ethnicities and cultures. This course will examine the ‘five Cs’ of effective communication and explain how to build boundaries and respect.
