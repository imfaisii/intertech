When a major issue with potentially serious consequences arises, one of the best things to do is split the difficulty into several components until it is resolved. The drill down methodology allows you to break complex problems into constituent parts. It simplifies dilemmas and identifies areas where more information is required to reach a reasonable solution. How can this technique be put to use effectively? This course demonstrates how to use this technique based on real-life examples across a range of industries. The material introduces you to the purpose and importance of this useful business tool. Next, we’ll discuss the concept of root cause analysis and highlight the process of carrying it out.</p><p>The drill down method can be delivered in a variety of ways. The modules will show you how to use the type 1 and type 2 drill downs for a range of scenarios. A drill down is carried out in a series of processes such as ‘identifying the issue’, ‘assembling the team’, ‘assessing the data’, ‘breaking down the issue’ and more. This course goes over these steps in greater detail. We'll then move on to the demonstration section by first looking at the process that you need to follow in order to build a drill down. We discuss in detail three separate demonstrations based on real-life examples. After that, we provide important hints and tips to help you use the technique effectively.</p><p>This is a fantastic root cause analysis tool that you can use extensively in your business to identify the main reason behind any problems that may be plaguing your organisation, whether they’re big or small. The most powerful aspect of this tool is that after deploying it, you can have confidence that you’ve identified the root cause of a problem and found the solutions to address the issue. This methodology can help you save money and time, and improve your overall customer and employee satisfaction with better-quality products, services and processes. So whether you are a project manager, business owner or company employee, this course will help with your own personal and professional development and that of your organisation.
