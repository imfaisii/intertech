Rather than use bribes, people made “offerings” to their gods and leaders in the hope of receiving favors. In a sense, such reciprocities provided a social glue that allowed cultures and civilizations to develop. But with civilization came religious and civil institutions that needed rules of fairness and good governance to ensure the loyalty and trust of the populace. Kings and pharaohs had to demonstrate that the rule of law was above the influence of greasy palms.

The adoption of a convention by the UN does not automatically bind all UN&nbsp;</span><span>members to comply with the convention. At the time a convention is adopted, a number of&nbsp;</span><span>countries will sign (become signatories) to the convention. By becoming signatories, those&nbsp;</span><span>countries indicate their general agreement with the principles and purposes of the&nbsp;</span><span>convention. However, countries are only bound by a convention or treaty by ratifying it.&nbsp;</span><span>Ratification signals that a country has laws and practices in place that are in compliance with&nbsp;</span><span>the convention and that the country is ready to be bound by the treaty under international&nbsp;</span><span>law.</span><div><span><br></span></div><div>In countries such as England, Canada and Australia, ratification is a power exercised by the Executive (i.e., the elected government and, more specifically, the cabinet). Parliamentary approval is not required, although all treaties and conventions are tabled in Parliament before ratification by Canada. In the US, ratification takes place through the combined actions of the Executive and a two-thirds vote of the Senate.</div><div><br>Once ratified, the particular state becomes a “party” or “state party” to the convention.<div><br></div>Some conventions have protocols.
