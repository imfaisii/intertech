We teach you the ILO conventions, how ILO works, its structure and how it works with IMO to resolve issues. The course discusses maritime law and admiralty law and how to distinguish between the two. We cover the main focus of maritime law and the complexities of admiralty law. Examine the U.S. Jones Act and its focus on providing medical care and income benefits for injured sailors in the line of duty, along with their dependents. Next, we outline the United States’ Longshoreman and Harbour Workers Compensation Act, which provides similar help for maritime workers who are not classified as seamen. You will learn about the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act responsible for governing claims involving damage to cargo shipped by sea internationally. This course comprises two modules covering various topics. We have broken these down using various illustrations to give you a comprehensive understanding of maritime law, UNCLOS zones and some sea acts.</p><p>This course then discusses the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and defines the rights and responsibilities of nations concerning their use of the world's oceans. It identifies the various areas of the world's seas as divided into zones of jurisdiction by UNCLOS. You will also learn about the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC), which sets the minimum standards to ensure satisfactory conditions of employment for seafarers. We explain internal waters and how the baseline is measured, then teach you about territorial water. Discover how territorial waters can extend to a maximum of 12NM from the baseline. You will also learn about UNCLOS's unique status of Archipelagic waters due to their natural resources. Next, this course describes the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). You will recognize the coastal state's rights, jurisdiction and duties within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In addition, you will learn about the international straits used for international navigation between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and the various duties of states bordering straits.</p><p>Furthermore, this course explains the tripartite nature of the MLC and its effects and highlights what the IMO conventions cover, such as: forced labor, freedom of association and protection of the right to organize and collective bargaining. Analyze the freedom of the high sea and what it contains. You will learn about the involvement of the UNCLOS in marine pollution. The course describes the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA) as a section of the United States code and how it governs the responsibilities and protections of shippers and carriers of cargo. It discusses the concept of seaworthiness and bills of lading with examples showing why you can see a ship as ‘not seaworthy’. You will learn about some uncontrollable causes of loss. It also outlines some of the shipper's responsibilities. It further explains the burden of proof and highlights the compensable damages under COGSA. Finally, this course explains legal action, limits of maritime liability and some circuit court admiralty cases on seaworthiness. This course will be of great interest to students, researchers and anyone interested in maritime law.

In the U.S., maritime law derived from the British admiralty courts that were present in the majority of U.S. colonies. A different and unique area of law, maritime law differs from common law.<div><br></div>The terms admiralty and maritime law are sometimes used interchangeably, but admiralty originally referred to a specific court in England and the American colonies that had jurisdiction over torts and contracts on the high seas, whereas substantive maritime law developed through the expansion of admiralty court jurisdiction to include all activities on the high seas and similar activities on Navigable Waters.<div><br></div>Because water commerce and navigation often involve foreign nations, much of the U.S. maritime law has evolved in concert with the maritime laws of other countries. The federal statutes that address maritime issues are often customized U.S. versions of the convention resolutions or treaties of international maritime law.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>T<span>he United Nations organizes and prepares these conventions and treaties through branches such as the International Maritime Organization and the International Labor Organization, which prepares conventions on the health, safety, and well-being of maritime workers.</span></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"iW8CT\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h5>Implementing International and US Maritime Regulations</h5></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"j11mQ\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\"><div><span>International maritime law involves interactions and conflicts between two or more countries.

The act follows and expands upon international law. It lays out who is responsible for the goods at each point in the process and what those responsibilities are.<div><br></div>In 1924 an international convention met to create international rules governing bills of lading. A bill of lading is basically a receipt given by a shipowner to a shipper. It acknowledges that goods have been received and the condition of those goods at the time. The bill also serves as a contract, letting both parties know where the goods are going and who will receive them at their destination.<div><br></div>In the United States, Congress chose to amend some of the so-called Hague Rules, laid out by the National Convention. The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act is the result of their efforts.
