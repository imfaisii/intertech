For your business to succeed, you must constantly improve its processes in order to boost productivity and sustain high-quality operational standards. However, business processes are supposed to be simple but can be complicated by complex systems, organisational structure and poor process development. In such a situation, how do we simplify a complicated process so that flaws and inefficiencies are eliminated? This course explains how to use a time value map (TVM) tool to visualise your business processes before making the necessary adjustments. We teach you the fundamentals of the TVM tool and show you how effective this tool is in identifying the flaws of a business process so that you can improve it.</p><p>We start by introducing you to the TVM tool and its role in the improvement of process workflows. We then lay out the components (time, value and map) of the TVM tool and discuss their role in analysing the steps and activities that make up a process. We demonstrate how using this tool makes it possible for you to graphically represent your process workflows for easier comprehension, interpretation and improvement. The course describes the tool and examines the three key constituents of the ‘value’ component. We explain how these key constituents help you to deliver the quality products and services that are important to your customers. We then highlight the importance of this tool and discuss when to implement it.</p><p>The course analyses case scenarios to teach you how to use the TVM tool to map out process workflows and pinpoint the areas that affect process efficiency. We explain how to build your own TVM and provide helpful tips that make the implementation of this tool more effective. The TVM tool can be used by anyone who is interested in improving business processes and increasing productivity and efficiency as it applies to any business or organisation. Process improvement is especially useful for business managers and leaders who want to identify areas of inefficiency in their operations and find ways to streamline them. The course has no prerequisites and is designed for anyone who wants to increase organisational productivity. Sign up to take control of your business’ process and boost productivity through the skilled application of time value maps.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
