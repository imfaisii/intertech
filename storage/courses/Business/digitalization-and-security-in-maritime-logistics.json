The shipper includes a full description of the cargo unit in his bill of sale to the consignee, describing the number of pieces and their details. This includes a description of the package with its dimensions, weight, country of origin, center of gravity, and lifting and securing points clearly marked on the outside of the crate. The crate is uniquely identified by a mark or number including the consignee’s name and address and port of discharge. This information is transcribed on to a pro-forma Bill of Lading or a booking note as a means of transmitting these details to the ship’s agent.<div><br></div>The ship’s agent incorporates the shipper’s data onto the ocean carrier’s official Bill of Lading and the data is entered with the growing list of cargo details on the cargo manifest. The ship’s agent prepares a cargo list for distribution to the stevedores, the port Captain, and the terminal operators with a brief description of the crate and its contents. Extraordinary dimensions of size, weight and hazardous nature of the cargo are also mentioned. A mate’s receipt is prepared with this cargo description. This document is sent to the stevedores for confirmation of receipt of cargo and its condition. Any handling damage is noted at this time. It is then given to the ship’s Chief Officer who signs it and returns it to the ship’s agent.<br></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"XW8tn\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" spellcheck=\"false\"><h5>Document Types</h5></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"7USnE\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" spellcheck=\"false\">Documentation associated with a vessel’s arrival, its acceptance of cargo for export, and its departure can be generally classified into two categories.

In a real-world application, from the engine room of a ship, all pressures, temperatures, levels, flow, rpm etc are continuously measured and the values (data) are communicated, following a standard protocol, to the computing device. The communication standards follow an industry approved format so that the computing device can interpret quickly. Similarly, the use of RFIDs in container ships have produced vast advantages</div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"xwT30\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" spellcheck=\"false\"><h5>Automatic Equipment Identification</h5></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"T3ljb\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" spellcheck=\"false\">The leading container terminals in the world today handle more than 20 million TEUs per year.
