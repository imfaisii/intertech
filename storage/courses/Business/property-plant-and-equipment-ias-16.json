Or are you a teacher preparing a lecture on IAS 16 for your class? If you are either of the above or even a layman looking to understand IAS 16 and its application, you have come to the right place. Property, plant and equipment (PP$E) represent the essential items in any business's financial statements. Their correct accounting treatment and measurement are therefore paramount for any business. Manish Gupta will be taking you through an in-depth analysis of IAS 16, which will ensure that these concepts become crystal clear. The course starts with a definition of ‘property, plant and equipment’. A clear understanding of the definition will ensure that only the correct items are recognised under IAS 16. As with other accounting standards, we will also discuss the recognition criteria. We will analyse the impact of identifying assets in the financial statements.</p><p>Wondering which costs to include in the cost of the asset you just purchased? The next section of the course works through the detailed portion of IAS 16, which deals with measuring costs. Reporting correctly valued assets is vital for a business and its shareholders. There are many costs incurred that are to be excluded from the asset's cost and expensed out. Whether it's an internally manufactured asset or a purchased one, these aspects will be dealt with in detail during the course. Many entities manufacture assets with so many components that it might be impossible to treat all of them separately. We will explore the correct treatment of assets and their components. As you utilise an asset throughout its life, its ability to generate returns starts to wane. Various other factors contribute to its decline in value. IAS 16 deals with this particular issue of subsequent asset valuation.</p><p>Are you confused about which depreciation methods to apply to the fixed assets in your organisation? Ensuring that the value of an asset accurately represents its earning capabilities is crucial. We explain depreciation and methods available for tracking depreciation under IAS 16. Like all accounting standards, the eventual goal is to ensure that the shareholders clearly understand the entity's position and performance. For this purpose, IAS 16 has set out detailed disclosure requirements that enhance the clarity for the readers of the financial statements. Whether it's a shareholder looking to purchase stocks within a company or a bank lending money, every stakeholder's first line of trust is the company's financial statements. Ensuring that accounting standards are adequately understood and applied correctly by those in charge of their preparation is thus critical. This course will help you achieve an understanding that provides proper application. So whether you are an accounting executive, an accounts teacher, an auditor or a shareholder, enhance your knowledge of IAS 16 and take your professional or personal journey forward!</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
