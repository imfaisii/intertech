They are also a necessary part of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodology. LSS combines business management methods focused on eliminating waste and providing value to customers with the lowest possible investment. It is crucial to understand every detail of the process of implementing LSS and the most effective way of understanding it is to create a process map. Process maps are visual representations of different operations of the business. They provide a visual glimpse of the necessary information, helping to determine the 'who', 'what', 'where', 'why', 'when' and 'how' aspects of any process. This course will teach you how to create process maps to identify, measure, analyse and improve business processes by following the Lean Six Sigma ‘define, measure, analyse, improve and control’ (DMAIC) framework.</p><p>If you map the flow of work with the help of graphs, charts, tables and images, it better guides understanding of a business process than a massive compiled report with a lot of data. We first give you an overview of the Lean Six Sigma method and the DMAIC approach to better grasp the purpose of different process maps. We will introduce you to the various tools used in mapping business processes. A specific symbol represents each element in the process. We will apprise you of the basic symbols such as the diamonds, boxes, ovals and rectangles used in a process map to describe key process elements. Then we explore tools like swim lane diagrams, value stream maps, the ‘suppliers, inputs, process, outputs and customers’ (SIPOC) approach, time value maps, value-add charts and spaghetti diagrams used for viewing and analysing process data. You will learn which tool to use in a particular phase of DMAIC and how to use them to identify bottlenecks, repetition and delays.</p><p>The tools and techniques taught in this course apply to any management system process. We will show you how to measure and analyse the time, money and value added in each process step from live examples. You will also learn how to use a process map to improve business processes, reduce waste and increase efficiency. A process map shows an entire process from the beginning to the end. They can thus be used as process documentation to improve communication within a team or train new employees. If you are a small business owner, project manager or business analyst, taking this course will help you develop your knowledge and skills. This course is for anyone who wants to learn about mapping tools and the correct application technique of process mapping. So why wait? Enrol in this course and comfortably create maps for any business process.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5062\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
