This free online course will take you on an exciting journey into the world of LSS.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>In almost all human endeavour, a certain amount of ‘waste’ is inevitable. Waste is generated by both domestic and commercial culinary activities, production, manufacturing, service delivery operations and even normal animal and human biological processes. Do you know that wastage is very costly to incur? Even though it seems normal for some waste to result from our daily activities, there are some instances that are the result of inefficiency and can ultimately lead to loss of resources, especially in manufacturing organizations. Waste must be avoided as much as possible. There are several techniques of doing so that come from manufacturing operations but one very prominent technique is the Lean Six Sigma (or LSS for short). What is LSS? How is it used? This course carefully examines these questions and provides answers. Lean Six Sigma is a great tool in the hands of an operations manager if properly deployed. This course takes you on a great learning journey on how to apply LSS to ensure efficiency in your organization.</p><p>It begins with an overview of Lean Six Sigma, including its benefits, toolkit and possible scenarios in which it is useful. What does ‘cause and effect’ mean in LSS? The course material gives you a vivid and simple explanation covering important aspects such as Ishikawa diagrams, 5 Whys, Pareto charts as well as the C&amp;E Matrix. It explains how the Lean Six Sigma toolkit can be used to work with ideas generated within an organization, covering important aspects of idea generation such as brainstorming, affinity diagrams and multi-voting. It also covers several important aspects of process mapping such as swim-lane, SIPOC (suppliers, inputs, process, outputs and customers) spaghetti diagrams and more. Do you know that customers have a significant role to play when making use of the LSS toolkit? The topic on ‘voice of the customer tools’ gives a great insight on how to use the LSS tools to take care of customer-based business problems.</p><p>If you want to be an operations manager or a resource efficiency manager (REM), this course is for you.
