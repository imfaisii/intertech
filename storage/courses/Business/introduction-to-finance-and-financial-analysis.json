Whether you work on Wall Street or in a small company, finance is vital to every business so understanding its fundamentals is key to your business education. Is there a place for ethics in the world of finance? This diploma course will help you realise why it is crucial for individuals working in the financial sector to have organisational, professional and personal ethical behaviour. Transparency within financial markets is essential, and you will be taught about the most important legislation. You will understand what criteria corporations use when making financial decisions, the purpose and types of different financial institutions, the largest stock exchange markets and leading players, and the purpose and function of a market index. This course will explain how stocks are valued and differentiate between the three models used in corporations’ valuations. Calculate an investment's dollar return and percentage return and use historical and average returns to predict future performance. Investigate the effect a bond's market price has on its yield, how to use the rating system to assess the risk associated with different bonds, how to purchase them, and why bond markets may not have price transparency. Discover how an organisation can finance its operations through bonds and identify different types of bonds and their duration, advantages and disadvantages. Finally, learn about the principal's liability in contracts, torts and criminal law, the agent's liability in tort and contract, and how to terminate agency relationships.</p><p>What are the primary financial statements and how is the information used for economic analysis and forecasting? This course presents the major financial statements: income statements, balance sheets and cash flows. Next, investigate the less commonly used financial statements such as the statement of equity and the free cash flow statement (different to the statement of cash flows just mentioned). Then, look at the income statement, the non-cash items and the effects of GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles). The balance sheet represents a firm's financial position at a single point in time. You will be able to identify assets, liability and shareholder's equity and learn how to compute the balance sheet equation. You will investigate the impact of taxes on firms and how different forms of a corporate organisation affect the tax obligations for the firm and the individual owners. Various types of taxes are defined and the impact of depreciation on taxable income is discussed. Ultimately, a tax credit is compared to a tax deduction and you are shown how to calculate tax liability and depreciation.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the course introduces the statement of cash flows, the three types of cash flows, their connection to other financial statements and the difference between economic value and market value. It also presents so-called forecasting or pro forma financial statements – pro forma income statements, balance sheets and cash budgets. After completing the course, you will be able to create a forecast of the income statement, using assumptions for the future growth of expenses and sales by category; and develop a forecast of a balance sheet and analyse it. The course emphasises the importance of cash and good cash management. After finishing, you will have detailed knowledge of both the uses and the limitations of financial statements. Do you want to know why financial ratios are necessary for understanding a business? This course exposes you to the different types of financial ratios, their formulas, how to compute them, and which financial statements contain the information needed to calculate them. You will learn how to interpret ratios and apply those interpretations to understanding a firm's activities. You will also be able to use ratio analysis to assess a company's performance to compare its performance to itself, competitors, industry and across time. Are you ready to make your first steps into the path of better understanding corporate finance and financial analysis?

It is a debt security under which the issuer owes\nthe holders a debt and, depending on the terms of the bond, is obliged to pay\nthem interest (the coupon). In addition, the issuer might have to repay the\nprincipal at a later date, which is termed the maturity. Interest is usually\npayable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, and sometimes monthly).

It is often fairly easy for an institution\nto sell a large quantity of bonds without affecting the price much, which may\nbe more difficult for equities. In effect, bonds are attractive because of\nthe comparative certainty of a fixed interest payment twice a year\nand a fixed lump sum at maturity.</div><div><br></div><div>Bondholders also enjoy a measure of legal protection: under the\nlaw of most countries, if a company goes bankrupt, its bondholders will often\nreceive some money back (the recovery amount), whereas the company's equity\nstock often ends up valueless.

However, the borrower's credit history and ability to repay, as well as the expected returns for the lender, are factors that also affect rates.</div><div data-type=\"mix\" class=\"my-prev\" style=\"display:none;\"><img draggable=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"my-prev-text p-asset\"> Enter your text here.. </div></div><audio controls=\"\" class=\"full-audio\" data-type=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\"><source src=\"\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio></div></li><li id=\"3\" class=\"tab ng-scope\" style=\"display: none;\" data-id=\"3\"><div class=\"tab-holder\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display: none;\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"\"><b>Senior debt</b>, frequently issued in the form of senior notes and sometimes referred to as senior loans<b>, is debt that takes priority over unsecured or junior debt owed by the issuer. </b>Senior debt has seniority over subordinated debt in the issuer's capital structure.

In the absence of insurance, an agent is at serious risk in this lawsuit-conscious age.&nbsp;</div><div>The risk is not total. The agent is not liable for torts of other agents unless he is personally at fault—for example, by negligently supervising a junior or by giving faulty instructions. For example, an agent, the general manager for a principal, hires Brown as a subordinate. Brown is competent to do the job but by failing to exercise proper control over a machine negligently injures Ted, a visitor to the premises. The principal and Brown are liable to Ted, but the agent is not. </div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"jm8E0\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h1><div>Summary 1</div></h1></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"4FtaE\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list list-item, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"list-item editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\"><ul class=\"\"><li class=\"\"><div>The\nterm <b>corporate&nbsp;bond </b>is typically\napplied to <b>longer-term debt instruments</b>.</div></li><li class=\"\"><div>Corporate bonds are often listed on major exchanges.<br></div></li><li class=\"\"><div>Corporate debt falls into <b>several broad categories</b>: secured debt and unsecured debt;

Some ratios are usually quoted as percentages, especially ratios that are usually or always less than 1, such as earnings yield, while others are usually quoted as decimal numbers, especially ratios that are usually more than 1, such as P/E ratio; these latter are also called multiples. Given any ratio, one can take its reciprocal; if the ratio was above 1, the reciprocal will be below 1, and conversely. The reciprocal expresses the same information, but may be more understandable: for instance, the earnings yield can be compared with bond yields, while the P/E ratio cannot be: for example, a P/E ratio of 20 corresponds to an earnings yield of 5%. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"cFnu7\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h3>Overview of Ratios</h3></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"Q80UZ\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty All\"><div><span>A </span><strong>financial ratio</strong><span> or </span><strong>accounting ratio</strong><span> is a relative magnitude of two selected numerical values\ntaken from an enterprise's financial statements.

Some ratios are usually quoted as percentages, especially ratios that are usually or always less than 1, such as earnings yield, while others are usually quoted as decimal numbers, especially ratios that are usually more than 1, such as P/E ratio; these latter are also called multiples. Given any ratio, one can take its reciprocal; if the ratio was above 1, the reciprocal will be below 1, and conversely. The reciprocal expresses the same information, but may be more understandable: for instance, the earnings yield can be compared with bond yields, while the P/E ratio cannot be: for example, a P/E ratio of 20 corresponds to an earnings yield of 5%. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"cFnu7\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h3>Overview of Ratios</h3></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"Q80UZ\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty All\"><div><span>A </span><strong>financial ratio</strong><span> or </span><strong>accounting ratio</strong><span> is a relative magnitude of two selected numerical values\ntaken from an enterprise's financial statements.

The reciprocal expresses the same information, but may be more understandable: for instance, the earnings yield can be compared with bond yields, while the P/E ratio cannot be: for example, a P/E ratio of 20 corresponds to an earnings yield of 5%. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"cFnu7\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h3>Overview of Ratios</h3></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"Q80UZ\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty All\"><div><span>A </span><strong>financial ratio</strong><span> or </span><strong>accounting ratio</strong><span> is a relative magnitude of two selected numerical values\ntaken from an enterprise's financial statements.

If shares in a\ncompany are traded in a financial market, the market price of the shares is\nused in certain financial ratios.</span></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"hfzvk\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list , listed selected-class   ui-resizable border\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"accordi editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope ng-empty None\"><ul accordion=\"\" class=\"v-accordion vAccordion--default ng-scope\"><li data-accordion=\"0\" class=\"v-pane ng-scope\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"v-pane-header\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"> New Tab </div><div class=\"v-pane-content\" style=\"display:none;\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"display:none;\">Enter your text here.. </div><div data-type=\"mix\" class=\"my-prev\" style=\"display:none;\"><img draggable=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\"><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"my-prev-text p-asset\"> Enter your text here.. </div></div><audio controls=\"\" class=\"full-audio\" data-type=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\"><source src=\"\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio></div></li><li data-accordion=\"1\" class=\"v-pane ng-scope active is-expanded\" style=\"display: block;\"><div class=\"v-pane-header\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><b>Sources of Data for Financial Ratios</b><br></div><div class=\"v-pane-content is-expanded\" style=\"\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"\"><div><span background-color:=\"\" initial;\"=\"\">Financial\nstatements are generally insufficient to provide information to investors on\ntheir own; <b>the numbers contained in those documents need to be put into context</b>\nso that investors can better understand different aspects of the company's\noperations.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span background-color:=\"\" initial;\"=\"\"><b>Ratio analysis </b>is one of three methods an investor can use to gain\nthat understanding.</span></div><div><span background-color:=\"\" initial;\"=\"\">A <b>financial ratio</b>, or <b><i>accounting ratio</i></b>, <b>is derived from a company's financial statements and is a calculation showing the relative magnitude of selected numerical values taken from those financial statements.</b><br></span></div><div><span background-color:=\"\" initial;\"=\"\"><div><div><b>Values used in calculating financial ratios are taken from the balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows or (sometimes) the statement of retained earnings</b>.

Some ratios are usually quoted as percentages, especially ratios that are usually or always less than 1, such as earnings yield, while others are usually quoted as decimal numbers, especially ratios that are usually more than 1, such as P/E ratio; these latter are also called multiples. Given any ratio, one can take its reciprocal; if the ratio was above 1, the reciprocal will be below 1, and conversely. The reciprocal expresses the same information, but may be more understandable: for instance, the earnings yield can be compared with bond yields, while the P/E ratio cannot be: for example, a P/E ratio of 20 corresponds to an earnings yield of 5%. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"jm8E0\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h3>Evaluating Financial Statements</h3></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"cTWrp\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed selected-class   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\"><div><b>Ratio analysis is a tool for evaluating\nfinancial statements but also relies on the numbers in the reported financial\nstatements being put into order to be used as ratios for comparison over time\nor across companies</b>.
