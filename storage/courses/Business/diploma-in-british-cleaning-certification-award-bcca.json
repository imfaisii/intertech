This diploma course explains how to find your niche in the cleaning industry that suits your expertise and resources. We outline various cleaning tasks required in domestic or business settings and go over the equipment and techniques required to safely perform them. We compare the different equipment and methods used in domestic and commercial cleaning. Kitchens are challenging and may harbour pathogens so we explain how to safely clean different areas and appliances used in both domestic and commercial kitchens. We then demonstrate how to set up a cleaning routine for bathrooms and toilets and which tools and chemicals you should use.</p><p>Hospitals require attention to tiny details during cleaning because of the danger of exposure to germs. This diploma course covers the cleaning and safety requirements for hospitals and provides tips for cleaning their wards, toilets and corridors. We examine specialised equipment and cleaning practices for such demanding tasks, which include pressure washing, machine sweeping and green cleaning. Working in the cleaning sector poses risks of work-related injuries and accidents no matter how carefully you perform your work. We lay out the common hazards present in workplaces and explain how to report and categorise work-related accidents before detailing the precautionary measures needed to avoid them.</p><p>The idea of starting your own business is both exciting and challenging because of its responsibilities, financial constraints and potential for profit. We lay out the pros and cons of launching a cleaning service. Our final section explains how to start a cleaning business and explores the dynamics of marketing, insurance, taxes and more. This diploma course is designed for those who want to enter the professional cleaning industry but also benefits anyone who wants to improve their cleaning skills. Cleaners are in high demand across every industry and this course trains you to take advantage of domestic and commercial work opportunities.

By being professional during meetings you can assure the person you are the right individual for the job, as well as clear up any issues the client may have. </div></div><audio controls=\"\" class=\"full-audio\" data-type=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\"><source src=\"\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio><div data-type=\"table\" table=\"\" class=\"div-table ng-scope\" style=\"display: none;\"><div data-row=\"0\" class=\"div-table-row\" style=\"display:none;\"><div data-col=\"1\" class=\"div-table-col\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"> Customer ID </div><div data-col=\"2\" class=\"div-table-col\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"> Customer Name </div></div></div></div></li></ul></div><ul accordion=\"\" class=\"v-accordion vAccordion--default ng-scope\" style=\"\"><li data-accordion=\"0\" class=\"v-pane ng-scope\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"v-pane-header\"> New Tab </div><div class=\"v-pane-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div data-type=\"text\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"display:none;\">Enter your text here.. </div><div data-type=\"mix\" class=\"my-prev\" style=\"display:none;\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><img draggable=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\"><div class=\"my-prev-text p-asset\"> Enter your text here.. </div></div><audio controls=\"\" class=\"full-audio\" data-type=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\"><source src=\"\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio><div data-type=\"table\" table=\"\" class=\"div-table ng-scope\"><div data-row=\"0\" class=\"div-table-row\" style=\"display:none;\"><div data-col=\"1\" class=\"div-table-col\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\">Customer ID</div><div data-col=\"2\" class=\"div-table-col\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\">Customer Name </div></div></div></div></li><li data-accordion=\"1\" class=\"v-pane ng-scope active is-expanded\" style=\"display: block;\"><div class=\"v-pane-header\">Dress Professionally</div><div class=\"v-pane-content is-expanded\" style=\"display: block;\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div data-type=\"text\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"\">You may have a uniform to wear for your cleaning business.

Once you have finished one room, close the door and do not go back in - to prevent you trailing dust from other rooms, back into ones that have been cleaned.</div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"VvoLf\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list image, listed ui-resizable  \" style=\"position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px; max-width: 232px; touch-action: auto;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"img-edit editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope None ng-not-empty hideText editing\" data-ng-click=\"addThumbnails(); changeFileType($index)\"><img draggable=\"draggable\" class=\"my-preview2\" src=\"images/1636021685415928398.png\"><div class=\"img-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>Select an Image from the Gallery</p></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"EmiRZ\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed ui-resizable  \" style=\"touch-action: auto;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched background\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" spellcheck=\"false\"><h6>Surface Cleaning</h6></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"rpdJq\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed selected-class   ui-resizable border\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" spellcheck=\"false\">Before cleaning any surface, always make sure it is free from large particles.

Once you have finished one room, close the door and do not go back in - to prevent you trailing dust from other rooms, back into ones that have been cleaned.</div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"VvoLf\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list image, listed ui-resizable  \" style=\"position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px; max-width: 232px; touch-action: auto;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"img-edit editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope None ng-not-empty hideText editing\" data-ng-click=\"addThumbnails(); changeFileType($index)\"><img draggable=\"draggable\" class=\"my-preview2\" src=\"images/1636021685415928398.png\"><div class=\"img-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>Select an Image from the Gallery</p></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"EmiRZ\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed ui-resizable  \" style=\"touch-action: auto;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched background\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" spellcheck=\"false\"><h6>Surface Cleaning</h6></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"rpdJq\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed selected-class   ui-resizable border\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" spellcheck=\"false\">Before cleaning any surface, always make sure it is free from large particles.

Once you have finished one room, close the door and do not go back in - to prevent you trailing dust from other rooms, back into ones that have been cleaned.</div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"VvoLf\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list image, listed ui-resizable  \" style=\"position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px; max-width: 232px; touch-action: auto;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"img-edit editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope None ng-not-empty hideText editing\" data-ng-click=\"addThumbnails(); changeFileType($index)\"><img draggable=\"draggable\" class=\"my-preview2\" src=\"images/1636021685415928398.png\"><div class=\"img-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>Select an Image from the Gallery</p></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"EmiRZ\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed ui-resizable  \" style=\"touch-action: auto;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched background\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" spellcheck=\"false\"><h6>Surface Cleaning</h6></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"rpdJq\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed selected-class   ui-resizable border\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" spellcheck=\"false\">Before cleaning any surface, always make sure it is free from large particles. This means brushing off any food or dust that has gathered. When there is no dried-on food affecting the surface, apply an all-purpose cleaner. Begin by scrubbing corners and edges thoroughly, and then wipe the surface clean using a cloth. If the surface has dried-on food, spray on some all-purpose cleaner, leave it to soak for five minutes, and then return to scrub off with a tough scrubber. Avoid using wire wool - as this can cause scratches.</div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"RZq3v\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h4>Cleaning Products and Clothing</h4></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"pbCTn\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed   ui-resizable\" style=\"position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px; max-width: 422px;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\"><b>Choosing the right cleaning products and clothing for your cleaning business is not just about being organised. </b>The clothes you choose to wear also speak volumes about how professional you are.
