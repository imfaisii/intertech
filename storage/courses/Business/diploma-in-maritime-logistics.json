Every business of shipment is facilitating a transaction in which a buyer has acquired a commodity, product, piece of machinery or other goods from a seller. This involves negotiation of sale and shipment terms between the seller and the buyer. A key consideration is the question regarding the party responsible for the cost and arrangement of transportation.<div><br></div>The INCOTERMS (discussed later) determine the responsibilities of each party relative to the transportation. Often both the buyer and the seller will have responsibility for one or more segments of the transportation process. One of the parties is responsible for arranging and paying for ocean transportation and is therefore known as the shipper. The shipper makes a basic determination on whether to utilize a liner service or charter a vessel in order to accomplish the ocean transit.</div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"DggI3\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list , listed selected-class   ui-resizable border\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"accordi editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope ng-empty None\"><ul accordion=\"\" class=\"v-accordion vAccordion--default ng-scope\"><li data-accordion=\"0\" class=\"v-pane ng-scope\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"v-pane-header\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"> New Tab </div><div class=\"v-pane-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"display:none;\">Enter your text here.. </div><div data-type=\"mix\" class=\"my-prev\" style=\"display:none;\"><img draggable=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\"><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"my-prev-text p-asset\"> Enter your text here.. </div></div><audio controls=\"\" class=\"full-audio\" data-type=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\"><source src=\"\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio></div></li><li data-accordion=\"1\" class=\"v-pane ng-scope is-expanded active\" style=\"display: block;\"><div class=\"v-pane-header\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" spellcheck=\"false\"><b> Liner Service </b></div><div class=\"v-pane-content is-expanded\" style=\"display: block;\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display: none;\"><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"\" spellcheck=\"false\">A liner service is a shipping service in which vessels are operated by a shipping company and call at a predetermined list of major ports known as a \"rotation.\" The ships \"rotate\" among the ports in the schedule.

They range from small 100 metres long to massive 350,000 tonnes capacity. Modern-day bulk carriers are characterised by a single screw type vessel with a high block coefficient. It should have low water flow resistance which will enhance its power. Further, the flow of water towards the rudder and propeller should be sufficient, considering the body shape.<div><br></div>A solid bulk cargo means the goods which are solids in particle or granular form, with or without moisture. They are generally homogeneous in composition and loaded directly into a vessel's cargo spaces without bagging or packaging.

It is subjected to various cargo handling terms. Most of these charters are of a single voyage nature, as trading patterns do not encourage round voyage trading. The payment received by the owner of the vessel is derived by multiplying the tons of cargo loaded on board times the agreed-upon freight rate expressed on a per-ton basis.

Ports are bound by the need to serve ships, and so access to navigable water has been the most important site consideration.<br></li><li class=\"\">Major container ports have two key determinants. One is the centrality and the other, intermediacy.<br></li><li class=\"\">Centrality refers to the port’s own business base, i.e., the containers originating and/or terminating in the port’s natural hinterland. Thus, ports located in areas with a huge population base typically have high centrality.<br></li><li class=\"\">Intermediacy refers to a port’s ability to capture incremental traffic such as transshipment cargo or intermodal cargo whose final destination is elsewhere.</li><li class=\"\">In addition to the public vs. private nature of container terminals, the terminals may be classified based on their method of container stowage. The two broad types of stowage are:<br>- stacking system – uses less acreage for container stowage<br>- chassis system – facilitates the expeditious movement of containers from the terminal area</li><li class=\"\">Individual marine terminals are located within a port and are the locations where ships dock and cargo operations are performed.<br></li><li class=\"\">Terminals are designed and operated to cater to specific types of ships and cargo modes.&nbsp;<br></li><li class=\"\">A port or terminal that does not offer such capability may be omitted from the transportation chain of the carrier's involved. Thus, ports and terminals are in a perennial effort to advance their intermodal and container handling capabilities and are investing huge sums of money for the same.&nbsp;<br></li></ul></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n"]}
