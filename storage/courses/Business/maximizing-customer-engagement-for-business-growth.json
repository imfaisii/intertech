Customer experience is thus what drives both engagement and satisfaction - and eventually customer conversions. Your customer engagement strategy should therefore focus on creating positive consumer experiences to continuously encourage people to do business with you. This course provides effective customer engagement strategies based on marketing and branding principles to foster business growth.</p><p>The first section explains the ‘audience first’ approach and highlights its benefits. We then explain how to calculate the customer lifetime value of a business. We demonstrate how understanding and optimizing the customers' lifetime value drives a business’ growth and long-term profitability. We also pinpoint approaches designed to generate positive word-of-mouth referrals by your customers.</p><p>The course’s next section discusses how you can use humor in marketing campaigns as a great way to connect with your audience and let your business stand apart from competitors. Finally, we examine the benefits of appreciating and retaining loyal customers and explain what to do in the event of a service mistake or failure committed by your company. This kind of customer service plays a key role in maintaining a strong brand image. Whether you are just starting a new business as an entrepreneur or managing an already existing one, you will find the marketing strategies covered in this course very useful.
