This change is felt more in the customer service area of organisations. Nowadays, you don't have to be physically present in an organisation to get information about that organisation. The Internet is there to help you connect with it and get the information you need. Also, with the Internet and modern technology, companies can easily get feedback from customers on the services they render. This course will show you the basic structure of Internet customer relationship management, also called the electronic CRM (eCRM) system. You will be shown the basic architecture of a data warehouse, and how it is essential in eCRM. You will learn about the key modules of eCRM such as campaign management, sales management, and managing customer feedback.</p><p>Subsequently, you will be introduced to the operations of contact centres. Successful companies take their contact centres very seriously as it is a key way to help their customers with enquiries while understanding their needs. Have you ever called the contact centre of a company and been told to stay on the line for some minutes and that an agent will be with you shortly? This is common and is one of the CRM strategies to make customers patient. In this course, you will learn how CRM strategies are implemented in the contact or call centres of organisations. Next, you will be introduced to the importance of global CRM (or GCRM). You will discover how cultural diversity impacts the implementation of CRM in an organisation. Furthermore, learn about a conceptual framework of global CRM and the importance of global account management in companies with multinational customers. Lastly, the course presents a case study to explain how GCRM can be implemented successfully in an organisation.</p><p>The management of customer relationships has evolved over the years and it is critical for businesses to understand how technology has played such a huge role in that. The use of technology, such as the Internet, has enabled a more efficient implementation of CRM and has made interaction between businesses and customers a lot easier. It is essential for business owners or CRM managers to understand this evolution as it helps with how they drive the success of their companies. This course will quickly show you how technology is instrumental to the management of customer relationships. Whether you are looking to be an in-demand CRM expert or just want to understand how the Internet has modified the way businesses manage their customer relationships, this course will give you a quick path to understanding that.
