The best known of the Viking ships is the Drakkar, the dragon-ship. The name came from the form of the head of this ship which represented a dragon head. This ship was very large and was used only for war. They required up to 60 rowers. It was very expensive to keep such a boat. It appeared around 1050 and King Olaf Tryggvasson is known to have had the most numerous fleet. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"SwS9K\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h5>Why Ships?</h5></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"7DiNo\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed ui-resizable\" style=\"max-width: 736px;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\">Logistics is all about using the right type of resources for the right results.

One is the centrality and the other, intermediacy.<br></li><li class=\"\">Centrality refers to the port’s own business base, i.e., the containers originating and/or terminating in the port’s natural hinterland. Thus, ports located in areas with a huge population base typically have high centrality.<br></li><li class=\"\">Intermediacy refers to a port’s ability to capture incremental traffic such as transshipment cargo or intermodal cargo whose final destination is elsewhere.</li><li class=\"\">In addition to the public vs. private nature of container terminals, the terminals may be classified based on their method of container stowage. The two broad types of stowage are:<br>- stacking system – uses less acreage for container stowage<br>- chassis system – facilitates the expeditious movement of containers from the terminal area</li><li class=\"\">Individual marine terminals are located within a port and are the locations where ships dock and cargo operations are performed.<br></li><li class=\"\">Terminals are designed and operated to cater to specific types of ships and cargo modes.&nbsp;<br></li><li class=\"\">A port or terminal that does not offer such capability may be omitted from the transportation chain of the carrier's involved.
