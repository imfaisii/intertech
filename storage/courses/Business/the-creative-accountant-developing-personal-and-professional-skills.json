For you to be able to handle these tasks with ease and efficiency, you need more than just technical accounting skills. You need to progress and grow as a professional and creative accountant. You need strategies and methods that can help you solve problems creatively and make decisions that have positive outcomes. This free online accounting course addresses just that; developing your personal and professional creative accounting skills to be a more capable problem-solver and effective decision-maker. You will start with some problem solving techniques that analyzes three types of problems: the Critical Problem, Tame Problem, and Wicked Problem. These three are discussed and it sets the basis for a more thorough examination later on in this business management certificate.&nbsp;</p><p>The following part of the content reviews the percentage of change programmes that often fail and the reasons, according to Professor Grint, why most of them fail. You will examine the main factors that result in poor solutions to problems, including a few specific reasons why we sometimes are unsuccessful at problem solving. The three types of problems (Critical, Tame and Wicked) are now deeply studied where you will learn how to identify each of these problems, gain a greater understanding for how they show up, as well as the tools and methods needed to deal with each of them.</p><p>In the final section of this problem solving course, you will study some techniques for solving problems and learn how to apply them.

Each of these are effective in their own right and you will learn which situation suits which problem-solving technique so you can apply these immediately in the workplace.
