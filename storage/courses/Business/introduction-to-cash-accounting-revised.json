This course will discuss the balance sheet and income statement in an easy to follow manner. In addition, you will look into the basic cash flow statement which shows how much cash is generated and used during a given time period.</p><p>This accounting course will introduce you to the practices and procedures of how cash accounting is done with income statements, cash flow statements, and balance sheets.
