Human resources or the people working in the organization are the most important resource.</li><li class=\"\">Human resource management is the process of employing people, training them, compensating them, developing policies relating to the workplace, and developing strategies to retain employees.</li><li class=\"\">There are seven main responsibilities of HRM managers: staffing, setting policies,compensation and benefits, retention, training, employment laws, and worker protection. In this book, each of these major areas will be included in a chapter or two.</li><li class=\"\">In addition to being concerned with the seven internal aspects, HRM managers must keep up to date with changes in the external environment that may impact their employees. The trends toward flexible schedules and telecommuting are examples of external aspects.</li><li class=\"\">To effectively understand how the external forces might affect human resources, it is important for the HR manager to read the HR literature, attend conferences, and utilize other ways to stay up to date with new laws, trends, and policies.</li></ul></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li>\n</ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\">\n<li id=\"HxGXI\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed ui-resizable  \">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched background\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h5>On successful completion of this module, students will be able to:</h5></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"H2ysl\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list list-item, listed selected-class ui-resizable  \">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div class=\"list-item editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\"><ul class=\"\"><li class=\"\">Explain the aspects need to create a usable and successful HRM plan.</li><li class=\"\">Explain the steps taken in the development of an HRM plan.</li><li class=\"\">Explain the differences between HRM and personnel management.</li><li class=\"\">Define the steps in HRM strategic planning.</li></ul></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li>\n</ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"4ObwQ\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h5><b>Context - The Value of Planning</b></h5></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"UUL6g\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed selected-class   ui-resizable border\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\"><div>James stumbled into his position as the human resource manager.

The compensation package, providing the basic salary, health benefits, and retirement plans, seems a bit old-fashioned for the type of company yours has become.</div><div><br></div><div><div>After reviewing your company’s strategic plan and your human resource management (HRM) strategic plan, you begin to develop a compensation plan that includes salary, health benefits, and retirement plans, but you feel it might be smart to better meet the needs of your employees by making some changes to these existing plans.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For example, you are considering implementing a team bonus program for high customer service ratings and coverage for alternative forms of medicine, such as acupuncture and massage. Instead of guessing what employees would like to see in their compensation packages, you decide to develop a compensation survey to assess what benefits are most important to your employees.&nbsp;<span>As you begin this task, you know it will be a lot of work, but it’s important to the continued recruitment, retention, and motivation of your current employees.</span></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li>\n</ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\">\n<li id=\"peDzY\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None background ng-touched\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h5><b>Compensation Package</b></h5></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"gsq4Y\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed   ui-resizable border\">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\"><div>There are a few basic aspects of compensation packages we should discuss before moving into the specific aspects of compensation.
