The last significant change in the law, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, was enacted by Congress in 1990. Legislation passed since then has made several minor changes. The Clean Air Act, like other laws enacted by Congress, was incorporated into the United States Code as Title 42, Chapter 85. Congress designed the Clean Air Act to protect public health and welfare from different types of air pollution caused by a diverse array of pollution sources. On October 8, 2008, the United States became a party to the Regulations for the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) 73/78, Annex VI (hereafter referred to as ‘Annex VI’). Starting on January 8, 2009, all U.S. ships must comply with the applicable portions of Annex VI. For the U.S. inspected vessels, the Coast Guard will verify shipboard compliance with the applicable provisions of Annex VI. They will issue an International Air Pollution Prevention (IAPP) Certificate or Annex VI COI endorsement as appropriate during routine scheduled inspections, such as during the review for certification or an annual re-inspection for endorsement on a COI. The coast guard will conduct Annex VI compliance exams in conjunction with other Coast Guard examinations or boardings and may issue IAPP Certificates upon request for uninspected vessels.</p><p>This course starts by explaining the history and the amendment of the Clean Air Act. You will learn about the control of common pollutants and other air pollution problems. Moreover, you will learn about EPA and MARPOL compliance for engines in addition to the emission control areas. We will take you through the EPA regulations for emissions from vehicles and engines besides its compliance requirements. The course outlines the primary diesel engine emissions and compares MARPOL and EPA applicability status before examining the regulations for emissions from marine spark-ignition engines. This course gives great detail to the domestic regulations for emissions from marine compression-ignition engines, including the international standards to reduce emissions from marine diesel engines and marine diesel engine fuels. It discusses the background and the tiers of the EPA evolution of nonroad diesel engine regulations. The course looks at the MARPOL Annex VI on NOx and SOx emissions from ship exhaust and emissions of ozone-depleting substances. You will also learn about the emission control areas along with the United State's regulators and enforcement.</p><p>This course on the Clean Air Act and Inspections aims at discussing the MARPOL Annex VI verification for U.S. flag vessels in addition to the IAPP certificate compliance dates and documents by vessel types. It analyzes the inspections of the EPA engine emission regulations besides technical files and engine documentation certifications. In addition, we investigate the international safety management code and the foreign flagship examination. You will learn about the inspections needed for hazardous and air pollutants from ships. We will also study the MARPOL Annex VI fuel oil sulfur standards and non-availability reports. Engines should be certified by U.S. EFA as meeting Clean Air Act Tier 3 concerning the issues incurred with low sulfur fuel. Understand the precautions necessary in handling low sulfur fuel oil and the procedures for fuel change-over. This course will be of great interest to students, researchers, marine engineers, environmentalists and anyone with an investment in protecting the marine environment by limiting air pollution by ship. Why wait? Start today and be a solution to helping our marine life!</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/3139\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.

The 1998 EPA final rule introduced Tier 1 standards for equipment under 37 kW (50 hp) and increasingly more stringent Tier 2 and Tier 3 standards for all equipment with phase-in schedules from 2000 to 2008. The Tier 1-3 standards are met through advanced engine design, with none/only limited use of exhaust gas after-treatment (oxidation catalysts).

On May 11, 2004, EPA signed the final rule introducing Tier 4 emission standards, which are phased-in over the period of 2008-2015. The Tier 4 standards require that emissions of PM and NOx be further reduced by about 90%.

On May 11, 2004, EPA signed the final rule introducing Tier 4 emission standards, which are phased-in over the period of 2008-2015. The Tier 4 standards require that emissions of PM and NOx be further reduced by about 90%. Such emission reductions can be achieved through the use of control technologies—including advanced exhaust gas after-treatment—similar to those required by the 2007-2010 standards for highway engines.</span><br></div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"NTEvG\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h5>EPA Evolution of Nonroad Diesel Engine Regulations</h5></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"Ze3kx\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed selected-class   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None background\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h6>Background</h6></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"LmGG3\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed   border ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" spellcheck=\"false\"><div>US-EPA has remained ahead of the internationally set regulations under the MARPOL and as such, vessels equipped with EPA certified emission-controlled engines at Tier 3 and Tier 4 levels can enter US- ECA/SECA without problems.
