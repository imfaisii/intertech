The best way to learn is through genuine understanding and experience, which is why this course uses a set of ground-breaking visualisation models that explain accounting transactions and balances using the analogy of water pipes and tanks. This simple but effective method lets you develop an intuitive understanding of how to manage cash flow and the accounting operating cycle. The models are used by leading universities to help their students understand financial concepts, and are built into this free online course.</p><p>By the end, you will understand cash flow, working capital, current assets and liabilities. You will also learn how profit and loss, assets and liabilities, and cash flow are all linked. This course follows directly on from Basic Accounting (https://alison.com/course/basic-accounting), which introduces all the building blocks of accounting, such as assets, liabilities, equity, debits and credits, financial statements and the fundamental accounting equation.</p><p>Even if you are familiar with some of these concepts, you will find it helpful to take that course as a precursor to this one to develop an intuitive understanding using our business simulation models. Whether you are completely new to finance, have never quite felt comfortable with how accounting works or simply want an engaging refresher, take this course to develop an intuitive understanding of basic accounting concepts.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
