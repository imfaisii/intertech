You will learn the skills involved in dealing with customers and the role of statutory bodies with guidance in best practices.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Relationships thrive on good communication. The secret of businesses is the ability to maintain an excellent customer-supplier relationship. In this association, the customer is the nursed one and more important because modern companies are not lacking quality products and services or distributorship; it lacks the customers that hinge the swings and flows of the business. Customer service is, therefore, a systematic platform that provides interaction between a company that sells a product and the buyers to satisfy and retain the customers. In its diversity, this platform aims at business survival and success.</p><p>Unfortunately, many industry hierarchies have neglected the crucial aspect of customer service to the brazenness of commercials to bring in new customers. This is an appalling entrepreneurship blunder because it costs far more to gain new customers than to retain existing ones. Neglecting, constraining or failing to optimise customer service capabilities wastes excellent opportunities. Technological advances have lifted customer service to innovative automated systems, but customers cannot be more satisfied with the touch of the human element. This technology boom has given rise to online stores that have had far more success than any walk-in business since inception. Amazon, an online shop in 2020, made a recorded delivery of 4.2 billion items to customers and is currently the highest net shop in the world thanks to its rich culture of customer satisfaction through calls, emails and live online interactions.</p><p>In the course, we will explore the dimensions of customer service as it generally relates to the core understanding, key components, requirements, responsibilities and cost and effectiveness of customer service. In addition, we will spend time learning about customers' attitudes and the legal requirements for every consumer policy associated with efficient customer service delivery. Each course module comes with reflective quizzes with answers and practical activities to make the course's learning enjoyable and worthwhile. Where a touch of modern businesses prioritising customer service has yielded gold, this course has all you need to fix the knowledge gap between companies and their customers, thus ensuring brand loyalty one customer at a time.
