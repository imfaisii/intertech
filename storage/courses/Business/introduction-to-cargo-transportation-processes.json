It will also familiarize you with the actions of the shipper when securing cargo, as well as the importance of ventilation in cargo transportation. The functions of petroleum logistics, as well as the importance of the supply chain in the oil industry, will also be covered in the material.</p><p>Next, this course explains the four types of shipping terms regulated by Incoterms (the global rules of trade for the sale of goods), as well as choke points in oil transportation. You will learn about loading and discharging operations in shipping, as well as the vital information that is exchanged in the pre-arrival checklist. This course will teach you about the metrics of cargo measurements, as well as how temperature and volume values are corrected.</p><p>Furthermore, you will get familiar with container systems as an essential part of maritime logistics, as well as the process of ‘containerization’. Learn about some liner service strategies and how they are applied, as well as the multi-trade strategies used in shipping today. This free online course will be of great use to students and researchers of modern maritime logistics, and anyone with an interest in the processes carried out during and after cargo transportation. </p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.

For example, when a ship sails from a cold climate into a warm climate, the cold steel of the ship’s structure come in contact with warm air, creating condensation in the hold.<div><br></div>Cargoes including newsprint or foodstuffs stand to be damaged by excessive moisture in the hold. In another example, cargoes such as grains and natural fibres emit heat when stored in an enclosed space including a ship’s cargo hold. This can result in overheating, deterioration, and in extreme cases, spontaneous combustion of the cargo.<div><br></div>The action to be taken to avoid these hazards is through proper ventilation. Ventilation is the process by which air from the outside is intentionally introduced into an enclosed space to replace the air that is stale, moist, poisonous or explosive. This may be accomplished by either natural or mechanical means. In most ships, trunkways for the passage of air connect the cargo spaces with the outside. In the case of mechanical or forced ventilation, fans are fitted in the trunkways.<div><br></div>An effective practice to cleanse the environment in the hold is to run one fan in the ventilate direction and the other in the exhaust direction. This clears the air faster but care should be taken to ensure that any air entering a cargo compartment is comparatively dry. Some cargo ventilation systems are fitted with humidity sensors and only permit air intake when the ambient humidity is low or after processing it through a dehumidifier. Using a dehumidifier is particularly beneficial when carrying sensitive cargoes such as newsprint and forest products.</div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"DS2aV\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" spellcheck=\"false\"><h5>Lesson Summary</h5></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"AWPIU\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list list-item, listed selected-class   ui-resizable border\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"list-item editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" spellcheck=\"false\"><ul class=\"\"><li class=\"\">Breakbulk cargo is in many ways, the most complex type of ocean born cargo to handle. </li><li class=\"\">Breakbulk cargo by definition is shipped in an infinite variety of sizes, dimensions, weights.
