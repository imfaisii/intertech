Kant believed that the end result is not of primary importance; rather, the real importance is in determining the moral intent of a decision or action itself. Kant would assess the morality of one’s action and disregard the consequences.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>He further believed that we have duties that are imperative and that these duties must never be abandoned, regardless of the anticipated outcome. These duties, according to Kant, are absolute and must be applied to everyone equally.<div><br></div>The notion of duty is important to law enforcement officers who are bound by law to perform their duty. A duty is something we are required to execute, regardless of whether we want to or not. The duty may have a personal or professional negative consequence attached to it, but as it is a requirement or obligation, it is absolute and/or imperative.</div></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li>\n</ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\">\n<li id=\"oKetU\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed  \">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h5>Virtue Ethics</h5></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"sCfuP\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list image, listed selected-class  \" style=\"touch-action: auto;\">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div class=\"img-edit editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope ng-not-empty None hideText\" data-ng-click=\"addThumbnails(); changeFileType($index)\">\n<img draggable=\"draggable\" class=\"my-preview2\" src=\"images/1574156770325485581.jpeg\">\n<div class=\"img-content\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<p>Select an Image from the Gallery</p>\n<span class=\"icon-image\"></span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"4sxUF\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed  \" style=\"touch-action: auto;\">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\">Virtue ethics has its historical background in ancient Greece and was primarily developed by Aristotle.<div><br></div>For the purposes of law enforcement, the major foundation in virtue ethics is the idea that if you are a good person, you will do good things, and to be good, you must do good (Pollock, 2007).

Throughout the world, people rely on a variety of religions to help them determine the most ethical action to take. While divine command theory is widely used throughout the world, there are differences: the application of the theory may differ from religion to religion, and it may differ within each religion.<div><br></div>One of the basic tenets for divine command theory is to use God as the source for all principles. In this way, to rely upon divine command theory, a person must believe that there is a willful and rational god that has provided the direction toward an ethical outcome. It is from God’s commands that actions are determined to be right or wrong and, because of this, divine command theory provides an objective assessment of what is ethical or moral.

While a common theme in academic discourse is that police culture is negative, entrenched in cynicism, masochism, loyalty above all else, and an “us versus them” mentality, it has positive aspects that are often overlooked. Members of the law enforcement subculture share values that enable officers to survive what at times is a difficult and emotionally taxing job. Values such as supportiveness, teamwork, perseverance, empathy, and caring enable officers to cope with posttraumatic stress; they are part of team of colleagues who care for their coworkers.<div><br></div><div>The support received from other officers is the result of shared values within the culture.
