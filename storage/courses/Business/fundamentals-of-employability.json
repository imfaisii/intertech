As soon as you start approaching companies, recruitment agencies or career services, you need to own “<b>Brand You</b>.” You need to be as <b>positive</b> and <b>successful</b> in your job-searching.<div><br></div><div>Google, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Skype and MySpace are names synonymous with social networking in the early 21st century. Social networks have become an integral part of people’s everyday lives and in fact, is so popular it has its very own language, for example, you can “Google” or be “Googled.” You can “friend” or “unfriend” someone on Facebook. And you can send tweets to update people on your every activity every moment of the day using your Twitter account. 2016 will be the year when recruiting on social media will become even more important in the war for talent. Over 900 million people worldwide use Facebook every day. A staggering 60% of UK recruiters are not using social media to source candidates. Source: Jobvite’s 2015 UK Social Recruitment Survey.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div>A recent study by an executive search firm found that 77 per cent of recruiters run searches of candidates on the Web to screen them; 35 per cent of these same recruiters say they’ve eliminated a candidate based on the information they uncovered. What does this mean for young jobseekers with regard to online profiles? Discuss as a group some of the postings that young people preparing for careers should be careful to avoid. Examples include: complaining about a former employer, showing pictures of hard-partying, descriptions of sexual exploits, abusive or aggressive language, etc.&nbsp;<br><br><div><br></div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"IZ8xv\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h3>How Candidates are Selected for Interview</h3></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"cERal\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list image, listed ui-resizable\" style=\"max-width: 316px;
