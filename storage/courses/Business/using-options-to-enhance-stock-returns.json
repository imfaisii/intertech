However, most of those who have discovered the stock market either leave it to advisers or invest in mutual funds because they do not have the time or energy to learn how to manage it themselves. The important thing to realise is that roughly 95% of mutual fund managers underperform every year. This course teaches you how to invest profitably using a stock investing strategy called a covered call. It starts by illustrating the reasons to stop paying fees to mutual fund managers and start managing your own money. You will then explore the basics of options and covered calls.</p><p>A covered call gives you the ability to earn a monthly return on income off the stock market. It allows you to buy stocks at under market value. It also increases the probability of making money every time you either own or purchase stocks. You will discover how covered calls made investing easy. Next, you will learn about the benefits and rules of covered calls. We also illustrate the three criteria that will help you to compare and choose the correct call. In addition, a visual example of a covered call will explain it in detail.</p><p>When you buy a stock, you do not know what will happen, and the probability of profit is 50% (either you will or you won’t make a profit). In a covered call scenario, that probability goes up to 62%. Also, you will discover the monthly routine you need to follow to manage your own money. The course introduces a stock investing strategy called ‘covered puts’. If you want to stop paying fees and learn how to manage your own money in fewer than 15 minutes a day, this is the course for you. A small investment of time and effort can pay off greatly over your lifetime. Sign up for this course now to learn the little secrets that investors use every day and start using them to your advantage.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4270\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
