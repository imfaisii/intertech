Consequently, most people look for solutions to resume their lives. Unfortunately, the same is true of businesses: difficulties will inevitably arise and the skilful development of problem-solving strategies is key to the success of any business. This course explores how to identify the problems in your business and develop and execute the appropriate problem-solving technique to manage them.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Starting up, sustaining and growing a business are no mean feats. They can be intensely painstaking and sometimes discouraging due to specific problems that arise in the industry. These business problems are inevitable. Anyone who ventures into any business without anticipating hurdles will likely be severely disappointed. In many cases, these problems are commonplace in the business sphere. However, they may present themselves in forms peculiar to you alone, either because of the nature of your business, the environment or some other factor, which makes solving them even more tasking.</p><p>It may be a daunting challenge to tackle some of the problems in your business. But regardless of the seriousness of the situation, solving it is imperative or your business will be adversely affected. This course will help you develop the right strategy to tackle these problems. You will learn to identify impending issues that may not already be obvious to you, thus letting you take precautions before things get out of hand. Further in the course, you will see how setting your objectives and defining your key results can lead to your sought-after success. We explain this process using a concept known as ‘Objectives and Key Results’ (OKR).</p><p>As you progress, you will eventually come to the core of the course as we bring the importance of brainstorming to the fore. This, among other concepts, involves a set of thought patterns known as ‘expansive’ or ‘reductive thinking’, which are thought processes that help to stimulate the right kind of strategy for solving your problem. Next is planning and execution. Finally, after developing the strategy, you have to act on it. The final phase of this course will guide you to do this effectively. Applying the methods outlined in this course can save your business from closing down.
