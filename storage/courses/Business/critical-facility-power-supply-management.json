All of society relies heavily on electrical power and power supply facilities to live their lives and manage their operations. This free online course will teach you about power supplies, power distribution systems, and distribution preventative measures in clearly and effectively.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>This course will first introduce you to the five key elements of Critical Operations and the possible threats that put those operations at risk. You will look at the different sectors of Critical Infrastructure and the three phases of crisis management. You will study electricity, voltage, electrical current, and amperes. You will also study single-phase and three-phase power as well as the most common sources that provide utility power.<br><br>You will then study Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), Load Bus Synchronization (LBS), and the important critical operation battery systems including switchgear batteries and control panels to name a few. This Power Supply Management course will then the discuss power distribution unit (PDU), closed transition transfer switch (CTTS), and static transfer switch (STS). You will learn the function of an automatic transfer switch (ATS), interlock, over-current protection, and protective relays. Finally, you will look into power distribution preventive maintenance.<br><br>Understanding the fundamental concepts related to power is a concern of every individual dependent on power sources, especially those who want to make a living by maintaining power distribution components. With an understanding of the different types of natural and alternative power sources as well as power distribution topologies, you will learn how to maintain power sources like the back of your hand.

How many components of a system have redundancy? Is it just extra capacity or really extra equipment? Does the extra equipment sit idle in standby, or can it be used for non¬critical functions until called upon in the event of a failure? To what extent can a single fault take out the primary component and the redundant component?</div></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li>\n</ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ui-sortable ng-not-empty\">\n<li id=\"13XM0\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\">\n<div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h5>Redundancy and&nbsp;Power Supply Transfer</h5></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"Ixdgj\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed selected-class   ui-resizable\">\n<div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-not-empty None\"><span>When it comes to providing power to your Critical Operations system, one of the most important things you need to consider is how to ensure that power is always being consistently supplied.
