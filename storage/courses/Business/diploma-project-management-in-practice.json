In their essential book on the topic, James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones describe Lean thinking as follows:</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><i>It provides a way to specify value, line up value-creating actions in the best sequence, conduct these activities without interruption whenever someone requests them, and perform them more and more effectively. In short, Lean thinking is Lean because it provides a way to do more and more with less and less—less human effort, less equipment, less time, and less space—while coming closer and closer to providing customers with exactly what they want. (Womack and Jones 2003, 15)</i><div><br></div>Throughout this course, we will be discussing Lean extensively.

In an article for </span><span><i>Planet Lean</i></span><span>, Michael Ballé explains:</span><br></div><i><div><i><br></i></div>Lean is often reduced to a manufacturing tactic because it doesn’t fit the frame of traditional strategy. Lean can’t tell you which niche to pursue, it can’t help you build a roadmap, and it won’t tell you what reasonable objectives are or how to incentivize people to get them.</i><div><i><br></i></div><i>Lean, however, is the key to creating dynamic strategies built on more mindful care of customers, more dynamic objectives (reduce the waste by half every year), faster learning, greater involvement of all people all the time for stronger morale, more determined focus on higher-level goals and quicker exploitation of unexpected opportunities.

This often includes clients, individuals or groups with approval authority, or groups of potential customers. Many projects struggle when the engineers responsible say, “We met our objective. We followed the plan as written” but the customer says, “You didn’t give me what I wanted.”</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div>Over the years, numerous products have been released and thereafter discontinued as specs didn’t fully match the customers’ needs. An example of this is the 2013 release of Facebook Home, a user interface for the Android phone that turned Facebook into the user’s home screen, removing the features, such as docks and app folders, that Android users love. How could the company make such a huge mistake?&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>According to Business Insider, the Facebook Home development team, composed primarily of iPhone users, “was unfamiliar with the features that a normal Android user might get used to, and might not want to lose when they installed Facebook Home” (Carlson 2013). This failure to learn about the customers’ needs had disastrous results. The price of the HTC First, the phone on which Facebook Home came preinstalled, dropped from $99 to 99 cents within a few weeks (Tate 2013). Ultimately, Time magazine named the HTC First one of the “lamest moments in tech” for 2013 (McCracken 2013).</div></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\">\n<li id=\"388l4\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h5><b>The Project Charter</b></h5></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div>\n</li><li id=\"IyPMe\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None background\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h6><b>Introduction</b></h6></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div>\n</li><li id=\"kKSQa\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed   ui-resizable\">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\">The development of the project charter is one of the most important aspects of project initiation.
