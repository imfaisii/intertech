However, even if you know what you’re going to do and how you’re going to do it, you still need one. Some people do succeed without having a plan. <div><br></div>However, these people are the exception and not the rule. Having a business plan significantly increases your chances for success.<span>The first rule of writing a business plan is to be realistic. Too many business plans are fantasies. Your plan should not convince other people of your potential. It should be used as a tool to help convince you that your ideas are realistic and achievable. Your business plan is not a grand plan; it is an organisational tool for you to rely on.</span><br><br><div>Your business plan should be the guide for your business operation, at least for the first few months. It should work as a plan that you can follow to make sure you are moving in the right direction to achieve your goals.&nbsp;<span>Your business plan should include your vision and your purpose. Many first time business owners are unconvinced of the need to carefully craft a company vision. However, these things are vital for your business.&nbsp;</span></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"HnFx0\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list image, listed   ui-resizable\" style=\"max-width: 48px; touch-action: auto;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"img-edit editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope ng-not-empty None hideText\" data-ng-click=\"addThumbnails(); changeFileType($index)\"><img draggable=\"draggable\" class=\"my-preview2\" src=\"images/1596191390667045841.png\"><div class=\"img-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>Select an Image from the Gallery</p><span class=\"icon-image\"></span></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"IA1Rq\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed   ui-resizable\" style=\"max-width: 646px; touch-action: auto;\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\">The final rule for creating your business plan is the financial proposal. You will use this part of the business plan when you go to the bank or if you’re looking for investors.
