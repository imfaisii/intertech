This administration course comprehensively explains the various skills and career progressions of a receptionist. We begin by introducing you to the basic concepts important to those who work in reception. We examine the different types of receptionist and compare their roles. Top-tier receptionists are expected to communicate effectively because they are the first point of contact with customers, both face-to-face and over the phone, and they play an important role in making a good first impression. We provide effective communication skills and discuss good telephone etiquette. We distinguish between formal and informal messages and emphasise the importance of confidentiality when taking and sending messages. Receptionists are privy to a lot of sensitive information and need to be discreet and skilled in managing it. We outline the basics of database management and show you how to ensure confidentiality with data.</p><p>As a receptionist, you may be required to make a variety of bookings or reservations. We provide effective scheduling techniques to help you manage reservations and other routine administrative tasks. The course compares the duties of a receptionist and those of a secretary. We then study filing systems to help you master the important task of managing them. Occupational health and safety is crucial to many industries and we explain how to prevent workplace accidents and protect your colleagues from risk. The course then provides the techniques required to make meetings successful, from arranging accommodation for attendees to record-keeping and writing minutes. Your grasp on organisational skills like time management will ensure that your office runs smoothly and efficiently.</p><p>The course examines the use of information technology in administrative work and identifies the software packages that are useful to a receptionist. We explore the concept of teamwork and relate it to the role of a receptionist who is a good team player. The reception area of an office in any industry plays a key role in making a first impression and must appear welcoming and professional to visitors. We therefore show you how to make yours more appealing and impressive to customers. A receptionist job keeps you busy and serves as a perfect springboard to further career progression. This course has no prerequisites and is intended for anyone who wants to be a receptionist. It also suits current administrators who want to improve their skills. Sign up to turn your talent for organisation and working with people into a rewarding career.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/5248\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.

On top of this, we&nbsp;will also explore what happens if you have a problem with a member of your team; this is an&nbsp;awkward situation at the best of times, but understanding how to handle it with grace and in the&nbsp;correct manner overall, is vital to ensuring that working relationships aren't damaged, as well as&nbsp;ensuring all your work is completed successfully.&nbsp;First things first, however; let's talk about what team work actually is.</div></div><audio controls=\"\" class=\"full-audio\" data-type=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\"><source src=\"\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio></div></li><li data-accordion=\"2\" class=\"v-pane ng-scope\" style=\"display: block;\"><div class=\"v-pane-header\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" spellcheck=\"false\"> What Is Team Work? </div><div class=\"v-pane-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"images/1667389532455676637.png\" style=\"display: none;\"><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"display:none;\">Enter your text here.. </div><div data-type=\"mix\" class=\"my-prev\" style=\"display: block;\"><img draggable=\"false\" src=\"images/1667389532455676637.png\"><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"my-prev-text p-asset\" spellcheck=\"false\">Team work is basically the process of working with other people&nbsp;towards a common aim.&nbsp;That's probably the simplest way to put it.&nbsp;Of course, team work is much more complex in practice, but generally&nbsp;speaking, the definition of the term means that you are all focused on&nbsp;completing the same thing, for the same reason.<div><br></div><div>Nobody is more important than anyone else within a team, hence the well-documented saying - There is no 'I' in team.</div><div><br></div><div>There are many situations whereby teamwork is required, and although you may be in a role which&nbsp;is a little individually based, e.g. you work in an office alone, the whole administrative section is&nbsp;strictly speaking a team.

Any large organisation will be keen to recruit to new posts from current workers, mainly because they already know the ropes in terms of how the organisation works, from the mail system, to where everything is, who people are, and the general day to day running of the organisation as a whole. This means that there are many chances to move within the organisation across your working life, using each job as a stepping stone to something greater, if you so wish. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"kgidc\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h4>Career Options as a Receptionist</h4></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"qYC4z\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list , listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"show-hide editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope ng-empty None\"><ul tabs=\"\" class=\"tab-navbar ng-scope\" style=\"display: none;\"><li data-name=\"0\" class=\"tab-title\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">New Tab</div></li><li data-name=\"1\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope active\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">Introduction to the Career Options of a Receptionist<br></div></li><li data-name=\"2\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">Types of Receptionist Roles You Can Undertake</div></li><li data-name=\"3\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">New Tab</div></li></ul><div class=\"wrapper-tab\" style=\"display: none;\"><ul class=\"tab-content\"><li id=\"0\" class=\"tab\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"tab-holder\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"display:none;\">Enter your text here.. </div><div data-type=\"mix\" class=\"my-prev\" style=\"display:none;\"><img draggable=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"my-prev-text p-asset\"> Enter your text here.. </div></div><audio controls=\"\" class=\"full-audio\" data-type=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\"><source src=\"\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio></div></li><li id=\"1\" class=\"tab ng-scope active\" style=\"display: list-item;\" data-id=\"1\"><div class=\"tab-holder\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"\"><b>As we move towards the end of our course, you should now have a broader overview in your&nbsp;mind of what makes a top receptionist, as well as being armed with plentiful information to&nbsp;help give you that slight extra edge in terms of performance.</b>&nbsp;In this particular module, we will talk about what happens next, i.e. your career progression options&nbsp;should you choose to move onwards and upwards from your role as receptionist.<div><br></div><div>Of course, maybe you're perfectly happy in your role, and that's fine, but if you are using your&nbsp;receptionist role as a stepping stone to bigger things, there are certainly plentiful options out there&nbsp;and roads you can take.

This means that there are many chances to move within the organisation across your working life, using each job as a stepping stone to something greater, if you so wish. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"kgidc\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h4>Career Options as a Receptionist</h4></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"qYC4z\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list , listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"show-hide editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope ng-empty None\"><ul tabs=\"\" class=\"tab-navbar ng-scope\" style=\"display: none;\"><li data-name=\"0\" class=\"tab-title\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">New Tab</div></li><li data-name=\"1\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope active\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">Introduction to the Career Options of a Receptionist<br></div></li><li data-name=\"2\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">Types of Receptionist Roles You Can Undertake</div></li><li data-name=\"3\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">New Tab</div></li></ul><div class=\"wrapper-tab\" style=\"display: none;\"><ul class=\"tab-content\"><li id=\"0\" class=\"tab\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"tab-holder\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"display:none;\">Enter your text here.. </div><div data-type=\"mix\" class=\"my-prev\" style=\"display:none;\"><img draggable=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"my-prev-text p-asset\"> Enter your text here.. </div></div><audio controls=\"\" class=\"full-audio\" data-type=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\"><source src=\"\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio></div></li><li id=\"1\" class=\"tab ng-scope active\" style=\"display: list-item;\" data-id=\"1\"><div class=\"tab-holder\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"\"><b>As we move towards the end of our course, you should now have a broader overview in your&nbsp;mind of what makes a top receptionist, as well as being armed with plentiful information to&nbsp;help give you that slight extra edge in terms of performance.</b>&nbsp;In this particular module, we will talk about what happens next, i.e. your career progression options&nbsp;should you choose to move onwards and upwards from your role as receptionist.<div><br></div><div>Of course, maybe you're perfectly happy in your role, and that's fine, but if you are using your&nbsp;receptionist role as a stepping stone to bigger things, there are certainly plentiful options out there&nbsp;and roads you can take.

This means that there are many chances to move within the organisation across your working life, using each job as a stepping stone to something greater, if you so wish. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"kgidc\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h4>Career Options as a Receptionist</h4></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"qYC4z\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list , listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"show-hide editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope ng-empty None\"><ul tabs=\"\" class=\"tab-navbar ng-scope\" style=\"display: none;\"><li data-name=\"0\" class=\"tab-title\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">New Tab</div></li><li data-name=\"1\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope active\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">Introduction to the Career Options of a Receptionist<br></div></li><li data-name=\"2\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">Types of Receptionist Roles You Can Undertake</div></li><li data-name=\"3\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">New Tab</div></li></ul><div class=\"wrapper-tab\" style=\"display: none;\"><ul class=\"tab-content\"><li id=\"0\" class=\"tab\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"tab-holder\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"display:none;\">Enter your text here.. </div><div data-type=\"mix\" class=\"my-prev\" style=\"display:none;\"><img draggable=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"my-prev-text p-asset\"> Enter your text here.. </div></div><audio controls=\"\" class=\"full-audio\" data-type=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\"><source src=\"\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio></div></li><li id=\"1\" class=\"tab ng-scope active\" style=\"display: list-item;\" data-id=\"1\"><div class=\"tab-holder\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"\"><b>As we move towards the end of our course, you should now have a broader overview in your&nbsp;mind of what makes a top receptionist, as well as being armed with plentiful information to&nbsp;help give you that slight extra edge in terms of performance.</b>&nbsp;In this particular module, we will talk about what happens next, i.e. your career progression options&nbsp;should you choose to move onwards and upwards from your role as receptionist.<div><br></div><div>Of course, maybe you're perfectly happy in your role, and that's fine, but if you are using your&nbsp;receptionist role as a stepping stone to bigger things, there are certainly plentiful options out there&nbsp;and roads you can take.

This means that there are many chances to move within the organisation across your working life, using each job as a stepping stone to something greater, if you so wish. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"kgidc\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h4>Career Options as a Receptionist</h4></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"qYC4z\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list , listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"show-hide editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope ng-empty None\"><ul tabs=\"\" class=\"tab-navbar ng-scope\" style=\"display: none;\"><li data-name=\"0\" class=\"tab-title\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">New Tab</div></li><li data-name=\"1\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope active\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">Introduction to the Career Options of a Receptionist<br></div></li><li data-name=\"2\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">Types of Receptionist Roles You Can Undertake</div></li><li data-name=\"3\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">New Tab</div></li></ul><div class=\"wrapper-tab\" style=\"display: none;\"><ul class=\"tab-content\"><li id=\"0\" class=\"tab\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"tab-holder\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"display:none;\">Enter your text here.. </div><div data-type=\"mix\" class=\"my-prev\" style=\"display:none;\"><img draggable=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"my-prev-text p-asset\"> Enter your text here.. </div></div><audio controls=\"\" class=\"full-audio\" data-type=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\"><source src=\"\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio></div></li><li id=\"1\" class=\"tab ng-scope active\" style=\"display: list-item;\" data-id=\"1\"><div class=\"tab-holder\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"\"><b>As we move towards the end of our course, you should now have a broader overview in your&nbsp;mind of what makes a top receptionist, as well as being armed with plentiful information to&nbsp;help give you that slight extra edge in terms of performance.</b>&nbsp;In this particular module, we will talk about what happens next, i.e. your career progression options&nbsp;should you choose to move onwards and upwards from your role as receptionist.<div><br></div><div>Of course, maybe you're perfectly happy in your role, and that's fine, but if you are using your&nbsp;receptionist role as a stepping stone to bigger things, there are certainly plentiful options out there&nbsp;and roads you can take.

This means that there are many chances to move within the organisation across your working life, using each job as a stepping stone to something greater, if you so wish. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"kgidc\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h4>Career Options as a Receptionist</h4></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"qYC4z\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list , listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"show-hide editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope ng-empty None\"><ul tabs=\"\" class=\"tab-navbar ng-scope\" style=\"display: none;\"><li data-name=\"0\" class=\"tab-title\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">New Tab</div></li><li data-name=\"1\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope active\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">Introduction to the Career Options of a Receptionist<br></div></li><li data-name=\"2\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">Types of Receptionist Roles You Can Undertake</div></li><li data-name=\"3\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">New Tab</div></li></ul><div class=\"wrapper-tab\" style=\"display: none;\"><ul class=\"tab-content\"><li id=\"0\" class=\"tab\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"tab-holder\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"display:none;\">Enter your text here.. </div><div data-type=\"mix\" class=\"my-prev\" style=\"display:none;\"><img draggable=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"my-prev-text p-asset\"> Enter your text here.. </div></div><audio controls=\"\" class=\"full-audio\" data-type=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\"><source src=\"\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio></div></li><li id=\"1\" class=\"tab ng-scope active\" style=\"display: list-item;\" data-id=\"1\"><div class=\"tab-holder\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"\"><b>As we move towards the end of our course, you should now have a broader overview in your&nbsp;mind of what makes a top receptionist, as well as being armed with plentiful information to&nbsp;help give you that slight extra edge in terms of performance.</b>&nbsp;In this particular module, we will talk about what happens next, i.e. your career progression options&nbsp;should you choose to move onwards and upwards from your role as receptionist.<div><br></div><div>Of course, maybe you're perfectly happy in your role, and that's fine, but if you are using your&nbsp;receptionist role as a stepping stone to bigger things, there are certainly plentiful options out there&nbsp;and roads you can take.

This means that there are many chances to move within the organisation across your working life, using each job as a stepping stone to something greater, if you so wish. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"kgidc\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h4>Career Options as a Receptionist</h4></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"qYC4z\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list , listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"show-hide editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-scope ng-empty None\"><ul tabs=\"\" class=\"tab-navbar ng-scope\" style=\"display: none;\"><li data-name=\"0\" class=\"tab-title\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">New Tab</div></li><li data-name=\"1\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope active\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">Introduction to the Career Options of a Receptionist<br></div></li><li data-name=\"2\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">Types of Receptionist Roles You Can Undertake</div></li><li data-name=\"3\" class=\"tab-title ng-scope\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><div class=\"text\" data-ng-blur=\"saveTabContent($event)\" ng-keyup=\"headingFromTab($event)\">New Tab</div></li></ul><div class=\"wrapper-tab\" style=\"display: none;\"><ul class=\"tab-content\"><li id=\"0\" class=\"tab\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"tab-holder\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"display:none;\">Enter your text here.. </div><div data-type=\"mix\" class=\"my-prev\" style=\"display:none;\"><img draggable=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"my-prev-text p-asset\"> Enter your text here.. </div></div><audio controls=\"\" class=\"full-audio\" data-type=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\"><source src=\"\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio></div></li><li id=\"1\" class=\"tab ng-scope active\" style=\"display: list-item;\" data-id=\"1\"><div class=\"tab-holder\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-keyup=\"keyupFromTab($event)\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"\"><b>As we move towards the end of our course, you should now have a broader overview in your&nbsp;mind of what makes a top receptionist, as well as being armed with plentiful information to&nbsp;help give you that slight extra edge in terms of performance.</b>&nbsp;In this particular module, we will talk about what happens next, i.e. your career progression options&nbsp;should you choose to move onwards and upwards from your role as receptionist.<div><br></div><div>Of course, maybe you're perfectly happy in your role, and that's fine, but if you are using your&nbsp;receptionist role as a stepping stone to bigger things, there are certainly plentiful options out there&nbsp;and roads you can take.

This means that there are many chances to move within the organisation across your working life, using each job as a stepping stone to something greater, if you so wish.
