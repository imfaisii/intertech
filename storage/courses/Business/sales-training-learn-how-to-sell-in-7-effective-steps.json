A free 60-page coursebook that breaks down all the techniques is included.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Numerous studies have shown that what buyers require from salespeople are competence and character. Competence is the ability to do something successfully or efficiently, which makes perfect sense, from a buyer's perspective. The very least they expect from a salesperson is expertise.</p><p>Character, on the other hand, is more subjective as 'one person's meat is another's poison'. For some of us, character could mean we want to work with a salesperson who is enthusiastic and friendly, while others may see this as off-putting, frivolous or just being too forward. Whatever character means to your prospective buyer, when you add competence to character, you create trust. Most importantly, people are influenced to change their behaviour - like going from a browser to a purchaser - by people that they trust.</p><p>In this course, you will learn about ‘4D selling’ and how using specific skills and techniques will allow you to earn our client's trust, and so become a trusted business partner and a strong influence for change. Finally, everything that you will discover in this course is wrapped up into a tried-and-trusted 7-step selling system that will allow you to take a prospect by the hand and guide them through the sale. Whether you are an entrepreneur, new to sales, or a sales manager looking to assign an effective sales training course to a new employee, this sales course is the ideal product for you.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
