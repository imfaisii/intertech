The HR professional might consider letting employees know of the compliance with this law.</li><li class=\"\">The EEOC is a federal agency charged with ensuring discrimination does not occur in the workplace. They oversee the equal employment opportunity (EEO) set of laws. Organizations must post EEO laws in a visible location at their workplace and also include them on job announcements.</li><li class=\"\">Related to the EEOC, the bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) makes it legal to discriminate in hiring based on special circumstances—for example, requiring the retirement of airline pilots at a certain age due to safety concerns.</li><li class=\"\">Disparate impact refers to a policy that may limit a protected EEO group from receiving fair treatment. Disparate impact might include a test or requirement that negatively impacts someone based on protected group status. An example is requiring a high school diploma, which may not directly impact the job. Disparate treatment refers to discrimination against an individual, such as the hiring of one person over another based-on race or gender.</li></ul></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li>\n</ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\">\n<li id=\"1AaBx\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched background\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h5>On successful completion of this module, students will be able to:</h5></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"tufrD\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list list-item, listed selected-class   ui-resizable border\">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div class=\"list-item editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\"><ul class=\"\"><li class=\"\">Name and discuss the steps in the selection process.<br></li><li class=\"\">Explain why criteria development is an important part of the selection process.</li><li class=\"\">Give examples of types of criteria that can be developed.</li><li class=\"\">Explain the advantages and disadvantages of internal and external candidates.</li><li class=\"\">Explain the various types of interviews and interview questions.</li><li class=\"\">Discuss interview methods and potential mistakes in interviewing candidates.</li><li class=\"\">Explain the interview process.</li><li class=\"\">Explain the types of tests that can be administered as part of the selection process.</li><li class=\"\">Discuss the types of selection models.</li><li class=\"\">Explain the steps involved in making the offer to the candidate.&nbsp;</li></ul></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li>\n</ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\">\n<li id=\"UPm6T\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable border\">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None background ng-touched\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h5><b>The Interview</b></h5></div>\n<div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"C7Noh\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed selected-class   ui-resizable\">\n<div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div>\n<div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\"><div>Many of us have or will sit in a waiting room with our best clothes on awaiting a job (or school) interview.
