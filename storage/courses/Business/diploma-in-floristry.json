We&nbsp;</span>can see on tombs, and in reliefs from Egypt,&nbsp;<span>Mesopotamia, Greece and ancient Rome, how&nbsp;</span>different principles of design prevailed in&nbsp;<span>the East and West down the ages.&nbsp;</span><div><br></div><div>The dead were honoured with Wreaths, Garlands and Festoons,&nbsp;<span>yet the style used today for garlands, festoons and wreaths&nbsp;</span>has not varied greatly in comparison to the ancient&nbsp;<span>techniques.&nbsp;</span><span>The arranging of flowers is an ancient form of artistic&nbsp;</span><span>endeavour dating way back to ancient Egypt.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Throughout our world history, people have always coveted the&nbsp;<span>natural beauty of fresh flowers. Just like it is today, floral&nbsp;</span>arrangements brought colour and nature to everyday scenarios&nbsp;<span>and also to special events. Although floral arrangement styles&nbsp;</span>have clearly varied in history and across continents, they all&nbsp;<span>had purpose and meaning embedded in it.</span></div><div><br><div>From the earliest times, it was the gardener&nbsp;<span>who made all the decorations personally,&nbsp;</span><span>assisted by an apprentice.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Flower decorating ‘just’ had to be beautiful as its purpose&nbsp;</span><span>and the gardeners made bunches with what was presently&nbsp;</span><span>available during the seasons. So it remained for centuries&nbsp;</span><span>until the dedicated art of arrangement and floristry emerged.&nbsp;</span><span>The story of floristry is closely linked to the evolution of&nbsp;</span><span>garden design, to general developments in taste and culture,&nbsp;</span><span>and most relevantly with the&nbsp;</span><span>decorative function of flowers in&nbsp;</span><span>the home throughout history.</span></div></div></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"Ce2Fr\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h1></h1><h3>Responsibilities as a Florist</h3></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"eqQBT\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" spellcheck=\"false\">Being a florist is not a cakewalk.
