You will look at the ways traditional retailers have had to rethink their business models and why they introduced innovations such as ‘lowest cost’, ‘convenience-location’, ‘convenience-preselection’ and ‘platform operator’.</p><p>Then look into a case study that analyses modern consumer behaviour and study the continued relevance and importance of brick-and-mortar shops. Learn why these traditional street-side shops that are rented out by businesses to be able to offer physical products and services to their customers face-to-face are still essential to shoppers. Lastly, the material will cover the different demographics of consumers and their buying habits.</p><p>Every business owner and manager dreams of massive foot traffic heading into their establishments. However, it takes more than just a retail store and merchandise to get those sales running: you also need research and training. This retail business course will give you the understanding of modern retail formats and consumer behaviour that will help you bring your business to the next level.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/1246\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
