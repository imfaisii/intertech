It starts with an overview of the practical aspects of launching an Amazon business. Although Amazon may not need any introduction, you will first find some interesting and lesser-known facts about the world's largest online retailer and marketplace. Discover what a brand is and why it is necessary to invest in one. Study how to start product research and brand your business. Explore the types of products for Amazon and where to look for inspiration. There are two different levels of Amazon accounts and you will learn the differences between them. We explain how a single login in Europe and North America allows you to sell across multiple countries. There is a referral fee Amazon applies to each sale. Before selling products on Amazon, decide which fulfilment method to use. We will walk you through the three distinct fulfilment options on the Amazon site in depth to help you decide which one is best for you.</p><p>Amazon operates a catalogue system, which implies a single entry for each barcoded item on Amazon. Create effective and efficient product listings. Are you aware that Amazon is one of the world's major search engines, rivalling Google as the first stop for people looking for products? First, understand how Amazon ‘search’ works and what are the ranking factors. Following that, study keywords, indexing, reviews and their effects on ranking. Next, learn how to boost sales performance by optimising product listing and discovering general principles for optimising titles, bullets, descriptions, images and other features. ‘Flat files’ are Excel or text files used for creating and uploading inventory in bulk and you will explore the complete process for downloading the correct flat file for creating products. Subsequently, we will describe the SKU Parent-Child Relationship and the process of making a variation listing.</p><p>The following section explores the pricing on Amazon, the effect Buy Box has on Amazon sales and the factors that govern which seller wins the Buy Box. We explain dynamic pricing and other pricing features, such as pricing health. Because every item on Amazon needs to have shipping specified, you will learn how to configure shipping options. Research how to use Amazon reports, such as payment reports, selling coach and business reports. Manage clients, orders and returns with ease and keep a high feedback score. Amazon metrics can help you improve your business performance and keep track of seller success. You will discover how to boost your business sales through the Amazon business programme. Deals, vouchers and promotions help you grow Amazon sales. Many sellers choose to buy advertising to increase their product's exposure. Amazon's advertising program is called ‘Amazon Sponsored Products’. Finally, we will explain the methods of organising and optimising sponsored brand campaigns. Start building a prosperous and long-term business on Amazon by taking this course immediately.</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/4626\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
