Thus, in some cases, you might have to build up the surface before painting.&nbsp;</div></div><audio controls=\"\" class=\"full-audio\" data-type=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\"><source src=\"\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio></div></li><li data-accordion=\"3\" class=\"v-pane ng-scope\" style=\"display: block;\"><div class=\"v-pane-header\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" spellcheck=\"false\"> Vinyl/Laminate Floors </div><div class=\"v-pane-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><img data-type=\"Image\" draggable=\"false\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn01.alison-static.net/publishing/dist/img/ab.png\" style=\"display:none;\"><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" data-type=\"text\" class=\"p-asset\" style=\"\" spellcheck=\"false\">Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to paint laminate or vinyl floors, but not all of these products will accept paint.

The more resin that is added to the paint, the shinier the finish becomes. These paints range from matt, flat paint with no sheen to full gloss paint, with the full, glossy sheen that stands out to the eye. For example, eggshell is a bit shinier than matt, silk is shinier than eggshell, and satin is shinier than silk but not as shiny as full gloss paint.

Vinyl silk has a high sheen and is good for rooms that have a lot of humidity or condensation, such as the bathroom or kitchen.&nbsp;</div></div><audio controls=\"\" class=\"full-audio\" data-type=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\"><source src=\"\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio><div data-type=\"table\" table=\"\" class=\"div-table ng-scope\" style=\"display: none;\"><div data-row=\"0\" class=\"div-table-row\" style=\"display:none;\"><div data-col=\"1\" class=\"div-table-col\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"> Customer ID </div><div data-col=\"2\" class=\"div-table-col\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"> Customer Name </div></div></div></div></li></ul></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"Ui6fZ\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty text-center None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h4>Types of Paint on the Market </h4></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"SohaL\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" spellcheck=\"false\">As you get into painting and decorating, you will find that you will use several different types of paint.&nbsp;The UK paint market is mainly divided into two types of paint, interior and exterior, though you will also find other types of paints out there.

The more resin that is added to the paint, the shinier the finish becomes. These paints range from matt, flat paint with no sheen to full gloss paint, with the full, glossy sheen that stands out to the eye.

The more resin that is added to the paint, the shinier the finish becomes. These paints range from matt, flat paint with no sheen to full gloss paint, with the full, glossy sheen that stands out to the eye. For example, eggshell is a bit shinier than matt, silk is shinier than eggshell, and satin is shinier than silk but not as shiny as full gloss paint.

The more resin that is added to the paint, the shinier the finish becomes. These paints range from matt, flat paint with no sheen to full gloss paint, with the full, glossy sheen that stands out to the eye. For example, eggshell is a bit shinier than matt, silk is shinier than eggshell, and satin is shinier than silk but not as shiny as full gloss paint.

The more resin that is added to the paint, the shinier the finish becomes. These paints range from matt, flat paint with no sheen to full gloss paint, with the full, glossy sheen that stands out to the eye. For example, eggshell is a bit shinier than matt, silk is shinier than eggshell, and satin is shinier than silk but not as shiny as full gloss paint.

The more resin that is added to the paint, the shinier the finish becomes. These paints range from matt, flat paint with no sheen to full gloss paint, with the full, glossy sheen that stands out to the eye. For example, eggshell is a bit shinier than matt, silk is shinier than eggshell, and satin is shinier than silk but not as shiny as full gloss paint.

The more resin that is added to the paint, the shinier the finish becomes. These paints range from matt, flat paint with no sheen to full gloss paint, with the full, glossy sheen that stands out to the eye. For example, eggshell is a bit shinier than matt, silk is shinier than eggshell, and satin is shinier than silk but not as shiny as full gloss paint.

The more resin that is added to the paint, the shinier the finish becomes. These paints range from matt, flat paint with no sheen to full gloss paint, with the full, glossy sheen that stands out to the eye. For example, eggshell is a bit shinier than matt, silk is shinier than eggshell, and satin is shinier than silk but not as shiny as full gloss paint.

The more resin that is added to the paint, the shinier the finish becomes. These paints range from matt, flat paint with no sheen to full gloss paint, with the full, glossy sheen that stands out to the eye. For example, eggshell is a bit shinier than matt, silk is shinier than eggshell, and satin is shinier than silk but not as shiny as full gloss paint.

The more resin that is added to the paint, the shinier the finish becomes. These paints range from matt, flat paint with no sheen to full gloss paint, with the full, glossy sheen that stands out to the eye. For example, eggshell is a bit shinier than matt, silk is shinier than eggshell, and satin is shinier than silk but not as shiny as full gloss paint.

The more resin that is added to the paint, the shinier the finish becomes. These paints range from matt, flat paint with no sheen to full gloss paint, with the full, glossy sheen that stands out to the eye. For example, eggshell is a bit shinier than matt, silk is shinier than eggshell, and satin is shinier than silk but not as shiny as full gloss paint.

These paints range from matt, flat paint with no sheen to full gloss paint, with the full, glossy sheen that stands out to the eye. For example, eggshell is a bit shinier than matt, silk is shinier than eggshell, and satin is shinier than silk but not as shiny as full gloss paint.

start painting, you need to apply your <b>primer</b>. Start by \"cutting in\" the primer. You do this by outlining the corners of the room. Next, create primer bands around the wall edges to meet ceilings, frames, hinges, and baseboards. Do not \"cut in\" the entire room all at once, as this will allow the border you create to dry, which means it might not blend well when applying the rest of the primer. Instead, it's best to cut in and then prime at once, which will create a seamless, smooth look. </div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"s3lqU\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" spellcheck=\"false\">Allow the primer to dry completely, and then use fine-grit sandpaper to lightly remove ridges, bumps, and other imperfections on the surface. Using a damp towel or sponge, wipe the wall after sanding, and allow it to dry.

Also, note that you should refill a paint tin with the paint in another tin when it's half empty. This way, you will avoid noticeable variations in colour. When the paint is ready, \"cut in\" the room a second time, but this time with the paint, not the primer. You should still have your painter's tape up and make sure that you brush it onto the wall first, not the tape when you apply the paint. When most of the paint is off the brush, only then should you begin to overlap your strokes to the tape. Next, apply the paint with a roller in the same way you apply the primer, working in small areas from the ceiling to the floor. Work from the ceiling to the floor and then from one side of the wall to the other, ensuring that you blend the areas as you move on.</div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li></ul>\n","\n<ul class=\"maintree ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ui-sortable ng-not-empty\"><li id=\"LSrmc\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list header, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div class=\"head editable ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty text-center None\" ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\"><h4><b>Lesson Summary</b></h4></div><div class=\"caption ng-binding\"></div></li><li id=\"DmlWZ\" data-space=\"\" full-editor=\"\" class=\"component list paragraph, listed   ui-resizable\"><div class=\"asset-header ng-binding\"></div><div ng-paste=\"removeFormat($event, item.title)\" class=\"editable p-asset ng-pristine ng-valid ng-binding ng-scope ng-not-empty None ng-touched\" spellcheck=\"false\">Before you start painting, you need to apply your <b>primer</b>.
