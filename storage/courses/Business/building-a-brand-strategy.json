Many people use ‘marketing’ and ‘branding’ interchangeably instead of one or the other. We will find out what the main differences are between them. Are you wondering how a brand can affect its customers' emotions and make people buy a product? We will explain these tactics in detail. We will examine hybrid brand solutions for small and medium-sized businesses and explore a Japanese technique to learn how it can help us define our business goals.</p><p>Then we will explain the four pillars of branding. We will discuss why we need to work on our values and mission and how they can play an essential role in brand success. Investigate the differences between values and abilities and how we can brainstorm our future abilities. Next, we will discuss the brand vision and find the key differences between vision and goals. Then we will analyse what archetypes are, what they have to do with marketing communications and how to use them in your businesses. Are you wondering what role brand names play in a business? We will debate how brand naming is a creative process and what factors make finding a good name difficult.</p><p>Then we will talk about the power of storytelling, how to write a brand story in your marketing efforts and what makes it compelling. Want to know the role visual identity plays in building a successful business brand? We will research how a brand gains trustworthiness through design and what goes into a visual identity booklet. We will also review the differences between working with a professional and creating your own design. The course is ideal for marketers who want to deepen their knowledge of building brand strategies or entrepreneurs who want to grow their businesses. So why wait?
