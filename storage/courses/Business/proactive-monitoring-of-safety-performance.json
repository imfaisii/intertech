One of the primary reasons they happen is the lack of monitoring measures by workplace management, who often resort to reactive monitoring measures like taking mitigating steps after an accident has occurred in the workplace. This approach can be helpful but it does not offer much regarding workplace safety.</p><p>Keeping this in mind, experts at Exoexcellence Consultants decided to develop a course that focuses on the importance of conducting proactive monitoring in the workplace. We have therefore divided the overall content into three base topics. You will find material describing proactive monitoring, its types, importance and critical activities in these topics. We will investigate the objectives of accident investigation and the active monitoring methods in detail.</p><p>The course will also enable you to analyse the records while conducting proactive monitoring in the workplace using checklists. In this regard, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of making checklists and have provided a sample to give you an idea of what a proactive monitoring checklist looks like and what should be its ideal contents. The course also contains a summary of all the course's essential points and a brief assessment to help you acquire the Alison certificate.
