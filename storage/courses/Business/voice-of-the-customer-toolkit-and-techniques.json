Successful businesses always pay close attention to what their customers are saying. They understand their needs and improve their products and services by listening and interacting with their customers. Customer interaction is the most effective way to ensure customers understand their products. In this light, how can you improve your customer's journey, product experience and services if you don't know what they're thinking? In this course, you will learn a successful methodology to help you reach out to your customers and build a business that improves customers' experience.</p><p>Understanding your customers and building a solid customer relationship is a methodical process. Lean Six Sigma is a highly effective business methodology. It comprises methods and tools used to collect and analyse customer data to meet the ultimate goal of improving quality, reducing waste and increasing customer satisfaction. First, we will help you understand how to outline an objective for your project. Then, with a specific aim in mind, you'll learn how to use the insight from your gathered data to improve your business. You will learn how to create a strategy, segment your customer based on market research and then decide on the type and source of data you want to create. Explore the different ‘Voice of the Customer’ (VOC) tools (interviews, surveys, point of use and focus groups) used to collect customer data on product quality, their uses, satisfaction, expectation, complaints and so on.</p><p>How do you decide which voice of the customer to prioritise? We will teach you how to analyse VOC data following the ‘Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control’ (DMAIC) framework using the Lean Six Sigma methods. You will understand which data to use at a particular step of the DMAIC and what the outcome of the analysis entails. Discover how to build a Kano model, map the delighters, dissatisfiers and performances and predict which voice you should give the highest priority. Finally, we'll show you how to use the ‘Critical to Quality’ (CTQ) tree to identify the customers' needs and translate them into a measurable product. You must listen to your customers and put their needs first to improve and grow your business.
