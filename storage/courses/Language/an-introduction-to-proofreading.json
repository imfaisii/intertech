This introductory course on proofreading aims to equip you with the skills and practices required to minimize errors found in texts and documents. Understand which writing situations tend to trip-up proofreaders the most, and ways to become better at producing error-free text. It is important to know how to avoid typing errors as this can cause a business to lose significant revenue or authors to embarrass themselves to their audience. Techniques applied to reduce errors include proofreading in quiet environments, with no disturbances such as phones or background chatter, and reading the text aloud to spot faulty sentence construction and bad grammar.</p><p>The course provides a diagnostic test that helps you identify your proofreading weaknesses using simple and easy-to-master methods and based on your profile, remedies and exercises are presented to improve those weaknesses. Toward the end of the course, additional practice tests will give you the chance to try out the new skills and see how well you can detect typos and errors. This English writing course also includes a comprehensive set of documents attached to the resource section so that you may use them for other projects, such as writing for books, websites, letters, emails, contracts, or other documents requiring proofreading.</p><p>Proofreading is similar to putting the final touches on a cake. Just the way icing covers any cracks or flaws in the cake and takes it to a whole new level, so does proofreading polish and perfect your document. The final stage of any writing process is proofreading, which checks and identifies any grammar, spelling and punctuation errors and corrects them. Proofreading is a lot more sophisticated and complex than a simple spell or grammar check. It consists of formulating style sheets that could be unique to each document being edited, and several methods can be employed to do the same. A good proofreading job is identifiable by its overall readability and professional style. You should note that it is crucial to understand that proofreading and editing are not the same. Editing comprises a lot more effort and skill as it involves modifying and correcting content and syntax. The first known forms of proofreading differ vastly from the methods employed today and dates as far back as the 15th century, around the time the portable printer was invented! If you have a reasonable grasp of English but keep getting caught with bloopers on your blog or in your newsletter and don’t know sound systems for improving your work, then this course is for you in order to empower yourself to become confident in your proofreading ability.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
