It covers topics such as pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. It provides a firm foundation in these areas to help you form everyday expressions, ask questions and meet basic needs related to food. The first section of the course explains how to pronounce and read words related to money and prices. We explore main currencies around the world and the many ways you can name the cost of a particular item. We demonstrate how to use the terms 'How much?' or 'How many?' to ask basic questions about food and its costs.</p><p>We then show you how to combine countable and uncountable nouns with these phrases. The course then lays out the terms 'any' and 'some' and teaches you how to respond in the positive or negative form. These phrases will help you to conduct a conversation in a shop or marketplace. The final part of our grammar section describes intensifier adverbs like 'really,' 'so,' 'very,' and 'too,' which help strengthen the expression's meaning and emphasize specific words in sentences.</p><p>The final section of the course provides vocabulary related to food. We identify various food groups, varieties found under each group, and the amounts and containers they typically come in. This can be useful when you travel or need to engage with English-speaking shop owners. English is a popular global language, and this course uses videos, images, and exercises to enhance your learning experience and give you the courage to speak the language.
