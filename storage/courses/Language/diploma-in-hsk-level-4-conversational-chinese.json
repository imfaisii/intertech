Many learners want to know if HSK level 4 is intermediate level Chinese or if this level is difficult. The HSK level 4 examination assesses your ability to apply everyday Chinese Mandarin like the previous levels. The intermediate level of daily conversations in Chinese Mandarin includes different tones and expressions. This course has passages related to discussions around service firms, career, business, employment, family and health. You will learn relevant new words. The practice questions at the end of each lesson will help you progress effectively by reinforcing the latest grammar and vocabulary learning. Like the earlier course on HSK 3, you will learn to identify and recognise the Chinese characters without their pinyin.</p><p>The first module focuses on sentence forms. How can I remember the Chinese sentence structure? This question haunts many learners and rightly so. Retaining the sentence structures is demanding but not impossible. As you progress through the first module, repeated practice and revision will enable you to master new grammar and vocabulary related to service firms, society, relationships and careers. The course's second module will continue with the conversations in different environments. New sentence patterns and discussions related to conditions, reading and business will enrich your proficiency level in Mandarin. Describing emotions, using adjectives and understanding the Chinese business language are covered. You will learn to use specific words to describe or express feelings and understand complex sentences. A revision lesson in this module will reinforce your learning and recap the essential grammar points.</p><p>The course's final module will cover many more conversations in different settings. The passages included will enable you to master the language so that you can converse on various topics with native speakers. The detailed explanations on how and where to use different words will continue adding value to your Mandarin language skill. There are notable advantages of learning Chinese, one of the most spoken languages globally. Taiwan and Singapore natives can also understand Mandarin since it is one of their official languages. Chinese and Japanese languages share some familiar characters: Kanji in Japanese is similar to Hanzi or Chinese characters. The numbers are also identical in both languages. Added proficiency in conversational Chinese will thus offer fresh opportunities abroad. As students, you can explore new avenues.
