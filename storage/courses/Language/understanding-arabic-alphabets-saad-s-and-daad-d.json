Its scripts are easier to understand for English speakers than others, but it is still a completely new writing system for beginners. What makes reading and writing in Arabic especially challenging for learners is the exclusion of most vowels in words. Arabic is also composed from right to left, which takes some practice to read and write. This specialist course introduces you to the 14th and 15th letters of the Arabic alphabet.</p><p>It starts with presenting the letter Saad (ص), the 14th letter. You will discover that the letter Saad has the sound of a strong ‘S’ in English. Next, you will explore the letter Saad (ص) with short and long vowels. In addition, you will learn how to write it depending on its position in the phrase.</p><p>The final section explains the 15th letter in Arabic, the letter Daad (ض). It has the sound of ‘D’ in English. You will explore the letter Daad with the short and long vowels, as well as Tanween. Arabic letters can have four different forms corresponding to an initial, middle, or final. Start learning how Saad (ص) and Daad (ض) link to the letter before or after them.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
