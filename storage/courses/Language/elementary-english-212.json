Knowing and understanding all the words and phrases necessary to hold a conversation if a disaster occurs in a universal language, such as English, may avert calamity. Our first topic covers vocabulary used to describe various weather systems. You will then learn the expressions employed during disaster response to prepare you for such emergencies.</p><p>The following two topics look at specific grammar areas. We begin with 'time clauses,' which indicate a temporal relationship between two actions or events. You never use them alone and always use them in conjunction with a 'main clause.' You will learn about future, present and past time clauses for events, like 'when' or 'after.' We then explore 'if statements,' which are part of conditional sentences. We compare time clauses ('when' statements) to conditional clauses ('if' statements). We explore zero conditional and first conditional uses. We demonstrate that the 'zero conditional' uses two present simple verbs and talks about permanent truths. In contrast, the 'first conditional' is used for realistic situations that may happen in the future.</p><p>Finally, you will use your newfound vocabulary and grammar skills to answer comprehension-type questions, from reading a 'Tornado Survivor Story' to listening to a sample hurricane weather forecast. Feel confident to conduct a 'disaster preparedness conversation' before downloading the 'Resource' section's writing activity. You will write a paragraph outlining an emergency plan using the writing tips and examples. This course is ideal for helping you gain confidence and improve your English skills.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
