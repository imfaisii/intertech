It is the primary language in Russia, Eastern Europe and other countries of the former Soviet Union. It is worth noting that Russian is one of the two official languages of outer space due to the vast contribution of Russia to aerospace technology as such - so astronauts must become conversant with the language. This course will examine the Russian alphabet in its classical order. You will study the four-letter groups of the Russian alphabet and discover how to discern each letter via its written and pronunciation patterns. Learn how to master the rules of reading in Russian by considering the systems of vocal articulation, the methods of reading letters and the word stress patterns in the language. The differences between the hard and soft consonants and their relatedness as correlative pairs will also be explained.</p><p>Next, the reading rules for unstressed vowels will be highlighted, accompanied by illustrative exercises to help you digest the concept comprehensively. Then we demonstrate Russian greetings, including how to express yourself in formal and informal business environments. We explore the basic manners required for hitch-free communications and smooth business transactions in Russian. For example, you will examine the Russian phrases for excuses and apologies and learn how to make personal requests in the language. The topic on personal pronouns and gender of nouns will dissect the three genders in the Russian language. Become skilful at identifying the gender of nouns via word endings and sibilant consonants. Furthermore, you will consider the Russian terms for various colours, and you will learn how to identify different objects by their colours.</p><p>Finally, the topic on Russian adjectives will examine the two main variances of adjective endings and identify them from their nominative case forms. You will study the two cases required for voiced consonant modification and apply the concept to the terms used for Russian foods. Similarly, we reveal the terms used for different animals in Russian. We teach you the verbs of the first conjugation in the present tense and their infinitive forms. Then we examine some adverbs and the second verb conjugation in the present tense.
