We explain how to combine different tenses and narrative verb forms to tell compelling stories. We study the past, present and future forms of verbs and compare them with past forms. We also discuss the role of collocations and common phrases used in English narratives and provide a storytelling guide to help you construct your own narratives.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>This course introduces you to countable and uncountable nouns. Countable nouns refer to something that can be counted such as ‘apples’ and have both singular and plural forms. We explain that the article 'a' or 'an' precedes these nouns’ singular form, for example, ‘a dog’ or ‘an apple’. Uncountable nouns can not typically be counted and usually do not have a plural form, although there are exceptions. You will learn that uncountable nouns are not preceded by 'a' or 'an', for example, ‘art’ or ‘electricity’.</p><p>The course then shows you how to use 'few' and 'many' with plural countable nouns as opposed to 'little' and 'much' with uncountable nouns (for example: ‘few apples’ and ‘little fruit’, ‘many buckets’ and ‘much water’). We then move on to the rules for using the articles 'a' and 'an', which we make easy by explaining English vowels and consonants. The course also teaches you how to use the article 'a' to specify how much and how often a noun appears and delves into the rules governing the article 'the'.</p><p>The grammatical rules surrounding articles and nouns are some of the easiest but most important to learn in the English language, which is why you will find this course deeply rewarding. This engaging intermediate level grammar course is also designed to improve your English reading comprehension, listening skills and accent. We can help you gain confidence in this global language as you learn how to use it to tell stories and hold conversations.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
