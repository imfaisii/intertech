Some people treat interviews casually and show up without any preparation or research, relying solely on their grades and attitude to qualify for the job. It's not easy to pass an interview and they often leave disappointed. Preparation is key to nailing this key step on the road to landing your dream job.</p><p>We begin by establishing the importance of fluency in English and possessing a wide vocabulary. In any interview, using accurate and precise words with the exact desired meaning can set you apart from the competition. We then show you how to conduct thorough research of the organization for which you wish to work. This can signal your seriousness and help you relate to your prospective employer during the interview. Your research can often reveal the reasoning behind the first few questions you face and best possible responses. This course supplies several standard questions and replies from real-life interviews. Prospective employers typically ask questions to learn about your personality, abilities, strengths and weaknesses and we explain how to successfully answer them.</p><p>Professionals use recognized techniques to craft questions in order to better understand interviewees. We go over one of the most well-known methods: the ‘STAR’ technique (‘STAR’ stands for ‘situation, task, action, result’). We study the five different types of STAR questions and go through many sample responses to help you refine your own. Not everyone aces their first job interview but this course prepares you to do so as we can help anyone who has struggled because their English skills lack polish. We provide guidance to job seekers, particularly fresh graduates who haven’t yet endured the gruelling job-seeking process and would like to avoid its disappointments.
