This English grammar course will teach you everything you need to know about phrasal verbs and how to use them. This will greatly improve your English language skills and get you closer to your first perfect English conversation.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>This English course on phrasal verbs will first teach you how phrasal verbs are constructed in the format of verb + preposition such as 'go off' and 'take over'. You will learn that many phrasal verbs such as 'wake up' have more than one meaning. The course will then teach you how to use phrasal verbs in Simple, Continuous and Past tenses. You will also learn that some prepositions are used for movement and that certain words change the meaning of the verb.<br><br>Next, you will learn that you may sometimes use more than one preposition with a phrasal verb and that many phrasal verbs use the words 'in' and 'out' with different meanings. The course will teach you how to use 'into' instead of 'in' when you talk about something going into something else. The course will also cover the phrasal verbs 'fill in', 'fill out', 'with in', and 'with out'. Finally, you will study the multiple meanings and uses of 'up, 'down', 'on' and 'off' in phrasal verbs.<br><br>Phrasal verbs are both very common in English conversations but also very confusing for people who don't understand them. This is why studying phrasal verbs is very important if you want to really improve in your English skills. They will help you sound more fluent, understand more of the English around you, and give you more confidence in your English ability. That's not bad for a free online English course. So why wait?
