We also explore the modals 'could,' 'should,' and 'shouldn't' and learn how to use them when asking for advice or making recommendations.</p><p>The final section offers reading and listening comprehension activities that reinforce the vocabulary and grammar you have learned throughout the course. We encourage speaking practice using the 'Ask and Answer' video footage before urging you to complete a downloadable writing exercise found in the 'Resources' section.
