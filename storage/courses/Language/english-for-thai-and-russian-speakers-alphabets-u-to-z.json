This course teaches you a range of new English words, including the letters U through Z, using attractive images and clear audio sounds. You will master letter recognition and recall, and become a more successful reader.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Phonemes correspond to letter sounds, but the relationship between the letter and the sound does not always exist when you say the word. A phoneme might have a specific pronunciation in one word and a slightly different pronunciation in another. You will improve your ability to hear, identify, and manipulate the sounds of each English letter from U to Z during this course. Images of objects associated with letter shapes and sounds aid in the memorising of letter names and pronunciation, improving your reading and speaking skills.</p><p>The next section of the course explains the letter U, and four different sounds in words like cube, umbrella, full and fur. After that, you'll see, listen and repeat the letter V and words containing it, such as van, volcano and village. The subsequent letter presented to you will be W, along with its name and sounds encountered in terms like wall, flower and wrong. Additionally, you will study the sentence structure for the present continuous tense and look at examples like 'He is working now'. Then you will discover the letter X and how to pronounce it in X-ray, wax or xylophone.</p><p>The final section delves into the different sounds that the letter Y makes. You will listen to and write expressions containing words such as shy, pyramid, yacht, and early with different 'Y' sounds. Finally, you will look at the pictures, and hear the name and sounds of the last letter of the English alphabet, Z, and recognize them in many words and phrases. This course combines phonics training, reading, and writing exercises for the final six letters of the English alphabet, allowing you to quickly and accurately identify words and become a more proficient English reader.</p><p>The course modules are presented in English with Thai and Russian subtitles to assist speakers of those languages.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
