Learning English can be daunting, and we have designed this course to help you study at the correct pace, increasing your vocabulary and building your grammar skills incrementally. Hence, you feel confident and proficient in the language. The first module concentrates on vocabulary relating to electronics before teaching you the common phrases and terms used while shopping.</p><p>The grammar component explains the possessive form of some parts of speech. Learn when to combine apostrophes with 's' and nouns when referring to people or things, for example: 'John's eyes are blue.' Discover how this works when using singular and plural nouns. We then study the possessive adjective. You use possessive adjectives with a noun to show someone owns something. Possessive adjectives do not use apostrophes; you use them to talk about family and friends. We compare 'its' to 'it's.' We discuss the possessive pronoun. A possessive pronoun expresses possession or ownership and can replace a noun phrase or avoid repetition when using names in a sentence.</p><p>In the final section of this course, you will practice all that you have learned and cement your understanding of the vocabulary and grammar rules. Verbal practice is essential if you want to excel in any language. This course will provide you with all the tools you need to go outdoors into the world and shop in any English-speaking country or with any English business owner. You will feel confident discussing electronic devices and be secure in asking and answering questions using the grammar and vocabulary you have learned.
