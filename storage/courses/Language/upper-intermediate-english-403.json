Do you want to protect the environment? More and more people are caring about this topic across the world, and the English language offers an opportunity for them to share their concerns. We have thus designed this course to teach you basic vocabulary concerning the environment. We begin by describing common words and phrases for green issues and activism.</p><p>This English course then moves on to the first of two grammar topics and explores noun clauses. You will learn how noun clauses can help you express ideas that regular nouns cannot. Discover how to use noun clauses as the subject of a sentence, the direct object of a sentence, and as adjective complements. The second topic covers embedded questions. We demonstrate how to include a question inside a 'bigger' question and ask one using a statement. To help you understand further, we compare and contrast common questions with their embedded counterparts. We also provide common phrases to help you use embedded questions.</p><p>You will then learn to integrate your new grammar and vocabulary skills by practicing reading, listening, and writing using what you have learned about the environment, noun clauses, and embedded questions. As you progress as an English student, ensure you practice forming paragraphs and not only simple sentences, which is a great way to master putting your ideas together. To help you acquire this skill, we have included some writing tips. To build confidence, you can download the writing exercises provided in our 'Resources' section.
