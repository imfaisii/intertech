In this course, you will understand how metaphor creates meaning in English and how to use this knowledge to understand English at a deeper level. You will also learn how to unlock new metaphors by applying knowledge of their structure and function.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>We are all familiar with the metaphor. It is a fundamental part of our language, to the point that we are often not aware when we are using it. The metaphor was long considered a linguistic embellishment, along with the simile, metonymy and analogy that offer alternatives to expressing the same ideas in literal language. That has now changed. With the understanding that a metaphor is a way of thinking, we have ideas like ‘conceptual mapping’ and ‘blending’, which open new ways to understand language at a deeper level and appreciate the creativity that language makes possible. We have realised that metaphorical thinking is fundamental to our ability to make sense of the world.</p><p>Beginning with the ground-breaking conceptual mapping ideas of George Lakoff, we analyse metaphors and identify the source and target domains that provide the relationships and structure within both superordinate (top-level) and basic-level metaphors. We discuss standard, widely-used and understood metaphors such as ‘life is a journey’ and ‘argument is war’. Explore the concept of the ‘conduit’ metaphor that presents language as a conduit through which words convey meaning. Explore how metaphors, such as ‘the mind is a container’ and ‘ideas are objects’, provide a new perspective on communication. Marshall McLuhan’s idea of a ‘global village’ will be critically examined in relation to the power of the internet. Gain insight into how orientational metaphors are constructed using simple prepositions in ways that bring together a multitude of meaningful relationships - all of which are firmly fixed in our everyday language.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be able to appreciate how metaphor is both a fundamental part of the language and a powerful creative device that expands the expressive potential of the language. Discover both the artistry and the power of metaphor, gain a deeper appreciation of how you have access to a wealth of expressive potential and acquire new analytical powers to unearth the metaphorical treasures in texts and speech.
