You will then study the differences and similarities between 'despite', 'in spite', 'though' and 'although'. You will learn that you use 'in case' when preparing for something that is unlikely to happen, and that 'unless' and 'not unless' are used in negative English sentences. You will also learn how to use 'if + not' instead of 'unless'. The course will then cover the prepositions 'as', 'just as', 'when', 'because', and 'since'.</p><p>You will then study the different ways you can use 'verb + like to', 'as though' and 'as if'. The course will also cover 'for', 'during + noun', 'while + subject + verb', 'while', and 'during'. You will learn how to use the past form of English verbs to talk about the present and the present form of the verb to talk about the future. Finally, you will study the uses of 'by', 'until', 'till', 'by the time', 'by then' and 'by that time'.</p><p>Expressing yourself in English will be so much easier once you have mastered prepositions and conjunctions. You will sound more fluent and be ready to take on much more advanced English skills in your next lesson. This will be a great boost for your confidence as you move forward with your English training and have more conversations with English-speaking people.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://alison.com/resume/courses/1308\" class=\"l-but course_btn\">Start Course Now</a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
