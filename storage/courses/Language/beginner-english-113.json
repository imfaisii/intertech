The first section focuses on contractions, two words that have been shortened and combined to form one word, and using an apostrophe to replace the missing letter. An example is 'they are' combined to form the word 'they're,' with the apostrophe replacing the letter 'a.' Next, you will learn to create contractions by combining a pronoun with the verb 'to be' or a pronoun with 'would.' You will discover the contractions combining a pronoun with 'have/has' and 'got' before finally learning to use the apostrophe with possessive nouns.</p><p>The next topic explores grammar related to future expressions. You will learn how to use present simple verbs for statements in the present and scheduled events in the future and then discuss the present continuous tense used to make future plans and arrangements. In this section, we also cover making future plans by using 'be' + 'going to,' discover how to form negatives, and ask 'yes/no' questions with 'be + going to,' particularly when we have arranged or unarranged intentions and when making future predictions.</p><p>The final topic deals with travel vocabulary, exploring common time expressions used to talk about future events, plans, arrangements, intentions, and predictions. These future time expressions include 'in,' 'on,' 'or,' and 'at.' We then use future time expressions such as 'next,' 'tonight,' 'tomorrow,' 'later,' and 'this' combined with a specific day, week, month, or year. If you want to improve your English speaking and language skills, this sought-after course will increase your confidence and ability.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
