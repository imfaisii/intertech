The association between the letters of written communication and the sounds of the verbal language is called phonics. This course includes visuals, audio, reading, and writing exercises to help you develop these two vital skills and become a more fluent reader and speller of English for Russian and Thai speakers.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>Letter recognition is a core component of learning to read. The ability to delineate between letters and their shapes should be taught before or alongside letter sounds. This course will help you bridge the gap between phonemic awareness and letter recognition to other phonics skills. You will explore letters, sounds and words and start to recognize the letters of the English alphabet, both majuscule (capital or upper-case) and small (lower-case) and their specific sounds in words. We will also highlight the ways of matching letters with their sounds and words to their phonetic transcriptions.</p><p>Just after that, you'll learn about the letter K and its various sounds in words such as kite, kiss, knee, and knight. Then, you'll learn to read and write the letter L and new terms such as leg, lake, and lemon. The distinctions between 'this' and 'these' are detailed next. You will also find out the name and sound of the letter M in words like melon, monkey, man, and milk, and correctly use the demonstrative pronouns this, that, these, and those. Continuing to follow that, you will view images and listen to the letter N before writing text that incorporates it.</p><p>Finally, the course introduces the letter O and its different sounds in one, orange, nose and house, and how it is pronounced ‘double o’ in book and blood. You'll also learn about adding an ending -s or -es to the verbs when the verb's subject is he, she or it. The course provides a chart of phonetic symbols for transcribing English sounds, as well as a variety of exercises such as listening and repeating after the speaker, listening and writing English words and sentences, writing words with the letters K, L, M, N or O at the beginning, in the middle or at the end and translating them into your native language and English. By completing this course, you will achieve better English pronunciation and feel more confident when speaking or writing English.</p><p>The course modules are presented in English with Thai and Russian transcripts to assist speakers of those languages.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
