As a result, learning a second language is becoming an essential part of our existence. The German language ranks third in the world regarding economic potential and is prevalent in philosophy, science, history, art, literature and music. It is one of the most widely spoken languages in business and knowing it can help you succeed in your career. In recent years, German has been identified as one of the most beneficial languages to learn and one of the most influential cultural languages in the Western world.&nbsp;</p><p>This course will teach you the German language's singular and plural personal pronouns and verbs. Then you will unravel the concepts behind the ‘stem convention’ used for personal pronouns and regular verbs used in conversations. Next, learn to answer simple questions like ‘where are you from?’, ‘what is your name?’ and ‘where do you live?’. We will also examine the singular and plural forms of the irregular verbs used in everyday dialogue. The use of articles in German is obligatory. We will teach you the definite and indefinite articles used in sentences and the singular and plural forms of the noun genders that activate them.&nbsp;</p><p>We then move on to the sentence structure of the German language. You will study the ‘Aussagesatz, Fragesatz, and Wortfrage’ sentence types used to express oneself in German. You will investigate cases, which are secondary tools that enhance your interactions with interlocutors. You will examine the nominative case of the language. We will clarify the personal and possessive pronouns and finally work through the three forms of adjective endings in German and their relevance in the language vocabulary.
