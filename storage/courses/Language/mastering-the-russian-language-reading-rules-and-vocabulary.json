It has over 144 million native speakers, but this figure varies depending on your source. Like any other dialect, it takes discipline and commitment to study. This course aims to provide an entertaining and effective way to obtain the ability to understand Cyrillic grammar and diction by using a straightforward method so you can master Russian and improve your skills.","courseOutcomes":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"courseDescription":"<p>The linguistic separation from the Late Common Slavic language (LCS) establishes three influential dialects still in use: Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian in the south, Polish and Czech in the west and Russian throughout the east. Knowing Russian is no more complicated than mastering any other language. Although Russian is an Indo-European dialect, it still does not differ dramatically from English due to the Greek and Latin origins of many grammatical constructions. Mastering Russian is like discovering a coding language with which you can experiment as much as your creativity permits.&nbsp;</p><p>This course aims to help you gain eloquence in Russian. The interactive material includes engaging activities such as listening, writing, reading and speaking. Without the Cyrillic alphabet, you will encounter more difficulty finding the definitions of Russian expressions but you can develop your skills by learning vocabulary, conjugations and popular expressions to practise phonetics and acquire fluency. This language course will prepare you for success regardless of your skill level. You will begin by learning colours and building your phrasebook with animals and popular toys. Then you will practise standard female and male nouns to identify the nuances between singular and plural Russian phrasing. Finally, you will practice your knowledge and rehearse each lesson content guided by Yauheniya Kliuyeva, a professional language instructor who will accompany you throughout the course to ensure your progress.</p><p>The material presented will ease you into Russian culture. Each new wording will build up a more solid vocabulary, getting you closer to fluency. The Russian language is so expressive, nuanced and powerful that the more you know, the better you appreciate its cultural value and way of thinking. The course will provide you with essential diction and phonetic examples to practice pluralising nouns and adjectives regarding specific themes or situations, from elemental colours to numbers, objects or shopping-related vocabulary. If you consider globalisation and the future of the Russian economy, then you will foresee the possibility of either doing business or working in Russia. You could also get hired as a consultant in the advertising and computer engineering fields. Would you like to acquire a fluent level of Russian? Then do not let anything or anyone block your way to success! Enrol and open the Slavic doors to your future.</p><a href=\"\" class=\"l-but course_btn\"> Start Course Now </a>","certificateDetail":"<p> All Alison courses are free to enrol study and complete.
